# Prohibition - Origins
The Prohibition movement had its roots in the early 19th century. During the Progressive Era, many reformers thought there was a link between alcohol and social problems.
America's entry into WWI also helped fuel Prohibition. The *manufacture of alcohol was seen as a waste of grain* that could've been used to feed civilians or doughboys. Many people equated drinking with foreign populations. Sheer patriotism helped reduce consumption in the US.
The Lever Food and Fuel Control Act of 1917 prohibited the use of grain in alcoholic beverages. The **18th Amendment** went into effect on January 29, 1920, and the national prohibition of alcohol became law.
# The 18th Amendment
Many states and local government agencies already had prohibition laws, but the 18th Amendment was the *first and only nationwide prohibition* in the US.
*Forbids the sale, manufacture, transportation, or importation of alcoholic beverages*. However, the amendment does not ban the consumption of alcohol, and establishments and individuals could serve and enjoy liquor *as long as they could prove that it was bought before* the 18th Amendment went into effect.
# The Volstead Act
Also known as the "National Prohibition Act"
Sponsored by Rep. Andrew Volstead
The 18th Amendment permitted Prohibition, but it didn't specify what constituted an "intoxicating liquor", nor did it establish penalties for violations.
According to the Volstead Act, *beverages with more than 0.5 percent alcohol violated the act*. However, "liquors" with more than 0.5 percent not designed for human consumption were allowed. The act kept legal alcohol used for medicinal purposes or religious observances. The act did not bar the consumption of alcohol purchased before the amendment. The Bureau of Internal Revenue legalized some quantities of homemade alcohol stronger than 0.5 percent.
# Speakeasies
*Establishments that sold illegal liquor*. Law enforcement was often bribed. "Blind pigs."
Speakeasies were underground saloons which sold illegal liquor. As Prohibition became less popular, many speakeasies began to serve food and host live bands and floor shows. Owners of speakeasies ran the risk of arrest and punishment. However, the profit was so great that they were willing to run the risk. Authorities arrested few owners, since many bribed police not to investigate their establishments.
# Prohibition - Enforcement
The government did not accurately predict the costs or effort needed for enforcement. The Volstead Act created the Prohibition Unit which became the Bureau of Prohibition by 1927, an entity in the Treasury Department. In some instances, people found ways to avoid Prohibition laws. Pharmacists could legally dispense medications based on alcohol.
# Al Capone
His business cards identified him as a Chicago "furniture dealer", but he actually headed an organized-crime syndicate, the Chicago Outfit, based around **bootlegging**, the illegal smuggling and sale of alcohol.
He was believed to have masterminded the 1929 St. Valentine's Day Massacre, in which members of a rival gang were gunned down in a Chicago garage.
Law enforcement officials couldn't pin Prohibition violations against him, but federal officials managed to convict him of income-tax evasion in 1931.
## St. Valentine's Day Massacre
February 14, 1929
7 members of the rival Moran gang were murdered.
Turned public support against organized crime
Prosecutors began to go after Capone
Capone was never directly linked to the murders.
## "The Untouchables"
Special federal Prohibition-enforcement group in Chicago led by Elliot Ness. They destroyed over two dozen breweries and distilleries. Called "Untouchables" because of their incorruptibility. Helped to secure indictments against Al Capone.
# Prohibition - Successes and Failures
## Successes
- Per capita consumption of alcohol decreased
- Public drunkenness arrests decreased
- Deaths from alcoholism dropped
- Fewer workers squandered paychecks on drinking
## Failures
- "Drys" insisted on abstinence, forcing many moderates to become lawbreakers
- Strict enforcement was nearly impossible
- Rise of organized crime
- Some were poisoned by homemade liquor
# Repeal of the 18th Amendment
Democrats realized in the late 1920s that Prohibition repeal could work as an election issue. The stock market crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression made repeal an even greater issue. Franklin D. Roosevelt promised to repeal the 18th Amendment if he became president. President Herbert Hoover established the National Committee on Law Observation and Enforcement (**Wickersham Commission**) to make recommendations regarding the future of Prohibition. Instead of repealing the 18th Amendment, the Wickersham Commission recommended that it remain and that more aggressive law enforcement efforts could force compliance.
Congress proposed the **21st Amendment** shortly after FDR's first inauguration. However, the amendment allowed state laws to remain in force as the "local option," in which a community can become a "dry" are under law. The 21st Amendment remains the only one that specifically repealed another.
# An Era of Strikes
A significant number of labor strikes marked the 1920s. During WWI, some unions like the American Federation of Labor signed a "no strike" pledge to not disrupt the war effort. With the war over, the American industry was affected by 2 major strikes, a nationwide steel strike and a coal strike.
Even with the victories of the strikes, the national labor movement went into decline during the 1920s. A great majority of laborers were immigrants used to working in harsh conditions, and uniting a big number of immigrant groups working in factories under a single organization was difficult.
# 1919 Boston Police Strike
Police officers asked for a pay raise, but management fired the officers' representatives who requested raises for the department, so the remaining police decided to go on strike.
**Governor Calvin Coolidge** called out the National Guard to patrol the city streets to maintain safety in Boston. He fired the striking officers who tried to return to work and hired replacements. Coolidge became a national hero for his handling of the strike and was nominated as Harding's running mate in 1920 and became president after his death in 1923.
# Foreign Policy in the 1920s
## Washington Naval Conference
The US and other countries tried to lessen the chances of another war. Representatives of 9 nations met in 1921 to conduct what became disarmament talks. The Five Power Treaty pact allowed the US and Britain 500k tons each of ships, Japan 300k tons, and France and Italy 175k tons each.
## Fordney-McCumber Tariff
Raised rates on imported goods to 60 percent in an attempt to protect the American industry. However, the tariff hurt Britain and France who had intended to repay war loans from the US by selling goods there.
The problem of trying to collect reparations from Germany led to the Dawes Plan. The issue of repayment hurt relations between the US and its allies.
## Kellogg-Briand Pact
The Republican administrators sought to eliminate war as an instrument of national policy. 61 nations signed the pact, but it was ultimately ineffective without a way for them to enforce its terms.
# Harding Administration Scandals
President Harding was generally considered a decent man, but he had difficulty staffing his administration with people not involved in criminal activity. When he took office, he brought friends and advisors known as the "Ohio gang". His disconnectedness from complex issues and tendency to trust the undeserving likely led to major scandals that marked his administration.
He appointed men of lesser ability and lower morals, like Veteran's Bureau head Forbes, who was convicted of selling government hospital supplies to private businesses.
## The Teapot Dome Scandal
Involved the illegal leasing of two naval oil reserves by Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall. Fall resigned his position and was charged by authorities for accepting bribes. Harding died before the scandal became public.
## Harding Dies, Coolidge Takes Office
President Harding died suddenly in 1923 when returning from a trip to Alaska. His health had become a concern earlier that year, and he nearly collapsed while giving a speech in Seattle earlier in the trip, complaining of violent cramps and indigestion. Doctors ordered him to San Francisco to rest and recuperate, and there he suffered what was probably a heart attack. Vice President Calvin Coolidge was notified at his father's home, and his father swore him in.
