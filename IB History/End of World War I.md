# The End of the War
- Armistice (ceasefire): 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918 (11 am on Nov. 11 1918)
	- Veteran's day
- Postwar settlement to be decided by the Big Three
	- French- wanted revenge
	- British- favored a more lenient settlement (punish Germany, but let them recover)

# Wilson's 14 Points Speech
- Wants the world to be safe to live in
- Bring world peace
# Peace Conference Challenges
- Conflict between the US, Britain, France
- France demanded harsh reparations
# Wilson's Gambles
- Ignored political realities by excluding Republicans
- Stressed himself to illness, impacting decision-making
> Wilson is a Republican and excluded Republicans from debating on the treaty.

# The Process
- Fractured peace-making process, Germany *excluded*.
- Wilson compromised on key issues like German war guilt.
# The Peace Settlement

# League of Nations
## Senate Opposition
- Irreconcilables: Opposed membership outright
- Moderates: Open to membership, had some reservations
- **Henry Cabot Lodge**'s group: Wanted amendments
- *Biggest roadblock*: Article 10
	- Required member nations to come to the aid of others
	- Lodge felt this interfered with American sovereignty
## Wilson's Refusal to Compromise
## Taking it to the American Public
- Wilson looked to the 1919 elections as a public referendum on the League of Nations.
	- Made membership in the league a key part of the Democratic Party platform

- Wilson toured the country to gain support
- Collapsed during the tour, ending his campaign
