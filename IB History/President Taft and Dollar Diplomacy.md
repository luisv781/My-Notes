# Taft: Dollar Diplomacy
- Similarity to TR
	- Wanted to expand US influence
- Difference:
	- Preferred economic investment to military / political intervention

## Dollar Diplomacy at work: China
- US banking group (led by J.P. Morgan) joins European banks in financing Huguang-Canton Railroad
- Control RR; Control economic development
- Counterbalanced Japanese/Russian investment and influence
## Dollars and Marines: The case of Nicaragua
- Nicaraguan President **Jose Santos Zelaya**
	- Nationalist
	- *Resented US influence*
- 1909
	- *Cancelled* economic privileges to US mining companies
	- *Threatens to invade* El Salvador
- Taft's Response:
	- Sends in Marines
	- *Overthrows Zelaya*
	- *Sets up pro-US regime* (Adolfo Diaz)
### Further intervention
- Sec. of State Knox
	- Encourages US banks to offer massive funds in return for 51% control of Nicaragua National bank
- 1912
	- Revolt against US backed government
	- US sent 3000 marines
	- Occupation lasts 10 years
# Wilson and Moral Diplomacy
- Foreign policy - desire to do good - idealism
	- Insisted Congress repeal US special privileges
	- Government would no longer support American investors aboard
	- Gave Colombia $25 million (Thought he owed them money for the Panama Canal)
- Cooperation in Latin America only possible with *"just" government* based on law
	- Will *oppose dictators* / support democracy
	- "I am going to teach the South American Republics to elect good men"
## Wilsonian Contradiction
- Wilson had been a vocal critic of TR and Taft's interventions in Latin America.
- Wilson involved the US in the affairs of foreign countries more than either TR or Taft.
> Wilson was *THE* US Anti-Imperialist. He contradicts himself and interferes just as much as the others.

## Wilson's interventions
- Haiti (1915)
	- Revolution prompts US to "restore order"
	- Occupation and supervision until 1934
- Dominican Republic (1915)
	- US Military control
	- Occupation until 1924
- Nicaragua- he voluntarily maintains occupation
# Wilson and Mexico: Backstory
- Porfirio Diaz- President of Mexico 1876-1911
- Modernized economy *at expense* of Mexican working class
- Mexican *elites and foreign investors benefitted*
- US and European countries *dominated* mining and oil industries
> Only the elites and foreign economies benefitted. The working class of Mexico was exploited.
## Mexican Revolutionaries: 1910
- **Francisco Madero**
	- Advocated for *political freedoms and reforms*
	- Challenged Diaz
	- *Won Election of 1911*
	- Offered no land reform, some elites *are still* in power
- **Emiliano Zapata**
	- Southern parts of Mexico
	- Advocated for *land and labor reforms* 
	- *Far more radical and revolutionary* than Madero
	- When Madero offered no reforms, Zapata led another rebellion

- **Gen. Victoriano Huerta**:
	- Originally Madero's chief general in civil war
	- Then *turned on him* and took power himself
- **Henry Lane Wilson**:
	- *US ambassador* to Mexico
	- Felt Madero wasn't up to the task
	- Thought Huerta was *better for business*
	- *Offered Huerta legitimacy*

> Henry was not really there for Mexico. He was there to make sure that American businesses are still making money.
> *Note: There is a president Wilson and an ambassador Wilson*
> Huerta becomes president.
## Intervention: 1914
- Wilson *authorizing selling arms* to **Gen. Venustiano Carranza**
- *Authorizes the invasion of the Mexican port of Veracruz*
	- US sailors had been arrested in Tampico (and soon released)
	- Ostensibly to prevent German arms shipments reaching Huerta
	- Casualties: 300 Mx; 90 US
- Huerta *vacates* presidency; flees to exile 12 August 1914
- More civil war ensues
> Wilson (ambassador) supported General Huerta because he seemed better for business.
> Wilson (president) did not support him and would not recognize his government. Instead he supported General Carranza.
# US involvement, 1915-16
- Carranza's govt *recognized* by US
	- Struggled to consolidate power
	- Also, not particularly democratic as president Wilson had hoped
- **Pancho Villa**
	- Revolutionary leader in northern Mexico
	- Villa's troops stop train in MX and shoot 17 Americans
	- Villa and troops raid Columbus, NM
		- Burns town
		- Murder 19 citizens
	- Motives?
> Pancho Villa was intentionally trying to provoke / bait the US into a full-scale invasion, which would weaken Carranza's government and use that to his own advantage.
> Wilson obliges.
# US Response
- Wilson sends Gen. Pershing and sends ~6k troops into Mexico to hunt down Villa
- Makes Villa even more popular
- Damages US-MX relations
- Loses support for Carranza
