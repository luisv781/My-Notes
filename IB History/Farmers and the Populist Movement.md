# Economic Distress
High cost of machinery led farmers to *borrow money*
Effects of the **greenbacks**
As money supply shrank, crop prices fell
Increased debt from expansion and high costs
> Greenbacks were paper money *not backed by gold* (you couldn't exchange them for gold) and were used to be able to print more money. After the Civil War, they retired and took them back. Hard money was worth more than greenbacks and included coins and paper money printed in yellow ink.

## Problems with Railroads
Farmers had to pay outrageously high prices to transport grain. There was lack of competition in railroads, so it cost more to ship grain by rail. Railroads could control grain storage prices and influence the market price of crops.
*High shipment and storage costs.*
Railroads charged Western farmers more, causing resentment. Farmers' Alliances grew, calling for lower interest rates and government regulation. (The Grange)

## Rise and Fall of the Populist Movement
### The Populist Party Platform:
- *Increase* money supply
- *Graduated* income tax (so taxes you pay depend on your income) and federal loan program.
- *Direct election* of senators and secret ballots (people's votes weren't secret)
- Eight-hour workday and immigration restrictions
### 1892 Presidential Election
Populist candidate *James Weaver* receives 22 electoral and 1 million popular votes.
### The Panic of 1893
- RR companies and banks collapsed
- Government's gold supply ran thin, sparking panic.
- 15K businesses and 500 banks failed
- Unemployment soared as 3 million lost jobs
> The recession was worldwide but it greatly affected the US

Gold Bugs and Silverites argued on bimetallism (adding silver to money supply) or the gold standard.

### Bryan and The Cross of Gold
*William Jennings Bryan*'s famous "Cross of Gold" speech (1896) DNC in Chicago. The cities need the farms more than the farms need the cities. He receives the Democratic nomination. Should the populists risk splitting the Silverite vote by nominating their own candidate? They decide to nominate Bryan with a different VP candidate.

### The End of Populism
1896 election: McKinley (pro-gold) vs. Bryan
McKinley won, signaling the end of Populism.
Populism's legacy: Political organization of the downtrodden, reforms enacted in the 20th century.
Bryan runs and loses 2 more times.
