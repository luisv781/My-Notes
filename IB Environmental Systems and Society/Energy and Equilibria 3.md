# Types of Feedback Loops
**Negative feedback loops (Stabilizing)**
- Occur when the output of a process *inhibits or reverses* the operation of the same process in such a way as to reduce change -- it counteracts deviation
- Return system to *original state*
- *Stabilizing* as they reduce change
**Positive feedback loops**
- Will tend to amplify changes and drive the system towards a *tipping point* where a new equilibrium is adopted.
- Change a system to a *new state*
- *Destabilizing* as they increase change
## Negative Feedback Example
- You are outside, on a hot day, and your body temperature becomes higher
- Sensors in your skin detect hotter surface temperature
- You begin sweating and the capillaries under your skin dilate to let heat escape from body
## Positive Feedback Example
- Global warming is causing temperatures world wide to rise
- This is causing ice-caps to melt, exposing soil below ice
- Since ice caps help reflect solar radiation back to the atmosphere, melting ice caps will increase solar radiation absorption on land
## What is a Tipping Point?
A **tipping point** is *the minimum amount of change within a system that will destabilize it*, causing it to reach a *new equilibrium* or stable state.
Reached when an ecosystem experiences a *new state*, where there is a *significant change* to its biodiversity and services.
### What factors are in tipping points?
- Changes are *long-lasting* towards environment or system
- Changes are *hard to reverse*
- *Time lag* between pressures causing change and appearance of impacts. It prevents scientists from intervening early in issue.
- Involves Positive Feedback-
	- Deforestation reduces rainfall, increases fire risk, forest dieback
### Examples of Tipping Points
- Lake Eutrophication
	- For effects to happen, nutrients must be continuously added over a long time period. Once there is enough nutrients, plants (like algae) grow excessively, and oxygen levels diminish. This kills aquatic organisms.
- Extinction of Keystone Species
	- If elephants from a savanna become extinct, it can critically affect the savanna environment. It will reach a new state that is irreversible.
- Coral Reef Death
	- If the acidity levels of the ocean keep rising, we will see more dead coral reefs. This is something that cannot regenerate.
## Resilience
- The resilience of a system, ecological or social, refers to *its tendency to avoid such tipping points* and maintain stability.
- More resilience of a system, the more disturbance it can deal with.
- Resilience is *usually a good thing* for the environment. It will survive different adversities.
- An example of bad resilience, is bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. Harmful bacteria that have a higher resilience will kill infected organisms.
### Resilience Example
**Eucalypt Forests of Australia**
- Bush fires happen in Australia
- Eucalypt plant has evolved to survive these wildfires
- Trees generate quickly after fires because 
### Factors that increase ecosystem resilience:
- A more diverse and complex ecosystem
- Greater species biodiversity
- Greater genetic diversity within species.
- Species that can shift geographical range (travel easily and adapt)
- Faster population growth
