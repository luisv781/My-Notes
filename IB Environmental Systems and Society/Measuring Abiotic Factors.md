# Identifying Organisms in Ecosystems
Ecology is the study of living organisms in relation to their environment.
When you are conducting an ecological study, you have to correctly identify the organisms and you can use a dichotomous key for identification.
# Measuring Abiotic Factors in Ecosystem
- Ecosystems can be divided into marine, freshwater, and terrestrial
- Each ecosystem type has their own set of abiotic factors and some are shared
- Marine environment abiotic factors: salinity, pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, wave action
- Freshwater environment abiotic factors: turbidity, pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, flow velocity
- Terrestrial environment abiotic factors: temperature, light intensity, wind speed, particle size, slope, soil moisture, drainage, mineral content.
## Evaluating Measures for Describing Abiotic Factors
- Light- A light-meter can be used to measure the light intensity
- Temperature- An electronic thermometer with probes (datalogger) allows temperature to be accurately measured in air, water, soil.
- pH- Measured using a pH meter or datalogging pH probe. Soil pH can be measured using a soil test kit.
- Wind- Measurements can be taken by observing the effects of wind on objects - these are then related to the Beaufort scale. Precise measurements with a digital anemometer.
- Particle Size- Particle size determines drainage and water-holding capacity
- Slope
	- Surface run-off is determined by slope, which can be calculated using a clinometer
	- Aspect can be determined by a compass
- Soil Moisture
	- Soils contain water and organic matter
	- Weighing samples before and after heating in an oven gives the weight of water evaporated and therefore moisture levels
	- Soil moisture probes are also available, which are simply pushed into the soil
- Mineral Content
	- The loss on ignition (LOI) test can determine mineral content
	- Soil samples are heated to high temperatures (500-1000 C) for several hours to allow volatile substances (that can evaporate) to escape
	- The loss of mass is equivalent to the quantity of volatile substances present
- Flow Velocity
	- Surface flow velocity can be measured by timing how long it takes a floating object to travel a certain distance.
	- More accurate measurements can be taken using a flow-meter
- Salinity
	- Salt content in liquid expressed in parts per thousand
	- Measured using electrical conductivity or by the density of the water (the higher the salt content, the higher the density)
- Dissolved Oxygen
	- Oxygen-sensitive electrodes connected to a meter can be used to measure dissolved oxygen.
- Wave Action
	- Measured using a dynamometer, which measured the force in the waves
- Turbidity
	- Cloudy water is said to have high turbidity and clear water has low turbidity
	- Measured using a Secchi disc, nephelometer, and turbidimeter.
