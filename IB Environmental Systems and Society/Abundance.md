**Abundance** refers to the relative representation of a species in an ecosystem.
You can work out the number or abundance of organisms in various ways.
- By directly counting the number of percentage cover of organisms in a selected area (for organisms that do not move or are limited in movement)
- By indirectly calculating abundance using a formula such as the Lincoln index (for animals that are motile)
# Lincoln Index
The **Lincoln Index** is used to estimate the total population size of a motile animal in the study area.
It's an indirect way of estimating the abundance of an animal population because a formula is used to calculate abundance rather than counting the total number of organisms directly.
$$
\text{Lincoln index}=\frac{n_{1}*n_{2}}{n_{m}}
$$
$n_{1}$ - number caught in first sample
$n_{2}$ - number caught in second sample
$n_{m}$ - number caught in the second sample that were marked
## Steps
- *Collecting* a sample from the population
- *Marking* the organisms in some way
- *Releasing* them back into the wild
- *Resampling* some time later and counting how many marked individuals you find in the second capture.
## Limitations
- Animals may move in and out of the sample area
- Density of the population in different habitats might vary: there may be many in one area, few in another
- The assumption that they are equally spread all might not be true
- Some individuals may be hidden by vegetation and therefore difficult to find: not included in the sample
# Direct methods of estimating the abundance of motile animals
- Direct methods of estimating abundance include actual counts and sampling
- These methods give the relative abundance of different animals in a sample
- Technology allows for direct counts of animal populations using aerial photography. Photographs can be taken of animal herds and the number of individuals counted using a computer
- To sample river organisms, the bed of the river is disturbed so that animals found there can be collected. The methods involves agitating the riverbed with a boot and collecting disturbed animals downstream in a net. Limitations: not all animals might be sampled from agitation.

# Quadrats
- Quadrats are used to limit the sampling area when you want to measure the population size of non-motile organisms. Quadrants are a frame that isolated an area.
- Quadrats vary in size from 0.25 m square to 1 m square
- The quadrat method is subjective, and different people will end up with different measures.
## Types of Quadrat Sampling
- **Random Sampling**: If your sample are contains the same habitat throughout. Quadrats should be located at random (use a random number generator).
- **Stratified Random Sampling**: If your sample are covers habitats that are very different from each other(an undisturbed and a disturbed area). So you take sets of results from both areas.
- **Systemic Sampling**: If the sample are is along an environmental gradient, you should place quadrats at set distances (every 5 m) along a transect (line through object or place) continuous sampling samples along the whole length of the transect.
# Population Density
- **Population density** is the number of individuals of each species per unit area.
- It is calculated by dividing the number of organisms sampled by the total area covered by the quadrats.
