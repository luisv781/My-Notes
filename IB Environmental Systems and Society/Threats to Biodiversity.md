# Speciation - Tectonic Plate Movements
- The surface of the Earth is divided into crustal, tectonic plates that have moved throughout geological time.
- The tectonic plates are located on the lithosphere(crust/upper mantle) layer of Earth
- Tectonic plates can separate, collide, and slip past each other. This can cause earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and create mountains
- This has led to the creation of both land bridges and physical barriers with evolutionary consequences
- The distribution of continents has also cause climatic variations and variation in food supply, both contributing to evolution
# Mass Extinctions
- Mass extinctions of the past have been caused by various factors:
	- Tectonic plate movements
	- Super-volcanic eruption
	- Climatic changes (including drought and ice ages)
	- and meteorite impact
- All of which resulted in new directions in evolution and therefore increased biodiversity
- The fossil record shows that over millions of years, there have been five mass extinctions, caused by natural physical (abiotic) phenomena.
- In mass extinctions, *species disappear in a geologically short time period*, usually between a few hundred thousand to a few million years.
## 5 Mass Extinction Effects
- Even though these mass extinction led to a massive loss of biodiversity, with less than 1% of all species that have ever existed still being alive today, they ultimately led to new biodiversity evolving
- The large-scale loss of species led to new opportunities for surviving populations, with many groups undergoing adaptive radiation (where an ancestral species evolves to fill different ecological niches, leading to new species)
## Earth's 6th Mass Extinction: Holocene
- The Earth is believed to be currently undergoing a sixth mass extinction, caused by human activities (biotic factors)
- The previous mass extinctions were believed to be caused by abiotic factors like temperature change, asteroids, volcanoes, etc.
- The 6th extinction can be divided into 2 phases:
	- Phase 1: began when the first modern humans began to disperse to different parts of the world about 100,000 years ago
	- Phase 2: began about 10,000 years ago when humans turned to agriculture.
- Main causes:
	- Overpopulation
	- Invasive species
	- Over-exploitation of resources
	- Pollution
	- Climate change
- Scientists believe that by the end of the 21st century, about 50% of species will be extinct
# Estimates on total species number
- Estimates of the total number of species on Earth vary considerably.
- They are based on mathematical models, which are influenced by classification issues and a lack of finance for scientific research
- Resulting in many habitats and groups being significantly under-recorded
## Classified Species
- The total number of classified species is a small fraction of the estimated total of species, and it continues to rise
- Estimates of extinction rates consequently are also varied, but current extinction rates are thought to be between 100 and 10,000 times greater than background rates.
## How many species are there on Earth?
- Estimates range from 5 million to 100 million, with the scientific consensus currently being around 9 million species
- Estimates:
	- animals: 7.77 million (12% of which are described)
	- fungi: 1.61 million (7% of which are described)
	- plants: 1.30 million (70% of which are described)
	- other species: 0.07 million
- These numbers are based on extrapolations from known info
- Places like the deep ocean and rainforests aren't fully studied yet
- Insect and bacteria and other microbes are not all known
# Loss of Species
- *The current rates of species loss are far greater now than in the recent past, due to increased human influence*
- The human activities that cause species extinctions include:
	- Habitat destruction
	- Introduction of invasive species
	- Pollution
	- Overharvesting
	- Hunting
---
# Causes of Species Loss
## Natural Causes
- Natural hazard events listed below have led to periods of biodiversity loss:
	- Volcanoes
	- Droughts
	- Ice ages
	- Meteor impacts
- Changes in the orbit of the Earth and its tilt, plus tectonic movement, have led to repeated long-term cold periods, which have resulted in the selection of species adapted to the colder conditions and extinction of less-adapted species.
## Habitat Destruction
### Farming
- Agricultural practices have led to the destruction of native habitats and replaced them with monocultures (crops of only one species)
- Ex: Sugar plantations have replaced tropical forest ecosystems, such as mangrove in Australia
- Ex: Oil palm plantations in South East Asia have led to the loss of tropical forests
### Mining
- Habitats can be lost though mining activities
- Cell phones contain an element called tantalum which is obtained by mining coltan(a metallic ore that contains the elements niobium and tantalum).
- Coltan is found mainly in the Democratic Republic of Congo - mining activities in these areas have led to extensive habitat destruction of forests that contain gorillas and other endangered animals
- Lithium mining for batteries
### Invasive Species
- Species that are introduced to areas and compete with endemic (native) species: this can lead to the extinction of the native species
- Invasive species don't have a predator keeping the population in check.
- Examples:
- The grey squirrel was introduced into the UK from North America. This species competes with native red squirrels and has led to a reduction in red squirrel numbers that the animal is now rare.
- Domestic cats in Australia are an invasive species.
- Wild hogs are an invasive species in the US
### Pollution
- Chemicals
- Fishing nets
- Plastic waste
- Oil spills
- Carbon emissions
- Pollution damages habitats and kills animals and plants, leading to the loss of life and reduction in species' population numbers
### Overharvesting and hunting
- Animals are hunted for:
	- Food
	- Medicines
	- Souvenirs
	- Fashion
	- Exotic pet trade
- Overharvesting of North Atlantic cod in the 1960s and 70s led to significant reduction in population number
- African Elephants almost became extinct because poachers would kill them for their tusks
# Tropical Biomes
- Tropical biomes contain some of the most globally biodiverse areas
- Their unsustainable exploitation results in massive losses in biodiversity and their ability to perform globally important ecological services.
- Tropical biomes are referred to as 'biodiversity hotspots' as they contain large numbers of species, often endemic to the area (not found anywhere else)
- Important functions of Tropical rain forests include
	- Prevent soil erosion and nutrient loss
	- Control the local water cycle (water evaporates from leaves in rainforest and falls locally as rain)
	- Act as carbon sinks (locking up in trees and other vegetation, carbon that would otherwise be in the atmosphere)
## Threats to tropical biomes
- About 3.7 acres of forest are cut down every 4 seconds
- Deforestation and forest degradation are driven by external demands for timber, beef, land for crops such as soya and oil palm, and biofuels
- Rainforests have thin, nutrient-poor soils. Because there are not may nutrients in the soil, it's difficult for rainforests to re-grow once they have been cleared. Can take up to 4000 years for full recovery
- A larger amount of timber removal may mean that the forest never fully recovers because fast-growing plants, such as vines and creepers, block out the light for slow growers, so the forest remains at a sub-climax level
## Ways to reduce threats
- Forest that are selectively harvested for timber (only large trees have been removed) can grow back rapidly if not too much timber has been removed.
- Developing 'carbon markets' - which value ecosystems as stores of carbon (in vegetation) - could provide the means to give sufficient monetary value to rainforests to help protect them.
- Ecotourism, a form of tourism directed towards natural environments with out harming, can help raise funds for conservation, educate visitors, and help the local economy.
## Conflict between exploitation, sustainable development, and conservation in tropical biomes
- Most tropical biomes occur in **less economically developed countries (LEDCs)**
- As a result, there is conflict between exploitation, sustainable development and conservation.
- **MEDCs (more economically developed countries)** have the luxury of being able to preserve their remaining natural ecosystems as they do not rely on these areas to provide income
- MEDCs cleared most of their natural ecosystems (i.e. climax communities) in the past. In the UK most native forests have been cleared.
- One of the traditional incomes from tropical rainforests was timber
	- **Conventional logging methods** were not selective and caused damage to remaining forests. All trees were cut down
	- **Selective logging methods**, like reduced impact logging (RIL), cause less damage and allow for faster generation of forests
- Conflict of LEDC of protecting environment vs exploiting to become MEDC. There needs to be a balance where the environment is conserved and sustainable development
# Red List of Species
- The International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN) publishes data in the "Red List of Threatened species"
- UCN Red List of Threatened Species
	- An essential inventory of species at risk of extinction
	- Published data in multiple categories to assess conservation needs
- Key Purposes of the Red List
	- Identify species requiring conservation efforts
	- Highlight species with concerning conservation statuses
	- Catalog plants and animals facing high risk of global extinction
	- Raise Awareness about species most in need of protection
## Factors and Explanations
- Population Size
	- Smaller populations are more vulnerable to extinction
	- Low generic diversity reduces adaptability to changes
- Trophic Level
	- Top predators are highly sensitive to disruptions in the food chain
	- Loss of lower trophic level species can have catastrophic effects
- Degree of Specialization
	- Species with specific habitat or diet needs are more vulnerable
	- Ex: Giant Panda's reliance on bamboo for survival
- Geographic Range
	- Species with limited habitat are at higher risk of extinction
	- Ex: Slender-billed Grackle - extinct due to marsh drainage near Mexico City
- Distributions
	- Species with small ranges face greater extinction risk
	- Loss of their habitat - loss of the species
- Reproductive Potential & Behavior
	- Species with long lifespans and slow reproduction (e.g. elephants, rhinos)
	- Low reproductive rates make recovery from population decline slower and more challenging
- Degree of Fragmentation
	- Species in fragmented habitats struggle to maintain viable populations
	- Ex: Sumatran Rhinoceros - habitat loss due to deforestation and plantation conversion in Southeast Asia
	- Plantation forests are man-made, limiting natural regeneration
- Quality of Habitat
	- Species in lower-quality habitats face higher risks of survival
	- Higher-quality habitats support healthier, more sustainable populations
- Probability of Extinction
	- Some species are naturally at high risk of extinction, even without human impact.
	- These species require urgent conservation efforts to prevent extinction.
