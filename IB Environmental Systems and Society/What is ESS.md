# What is ESS? (Environmental Systems and Society)
- ### Environment
	- For an animal or plant is defined as the external surroundings that act on it and affect its survival
		- Extended from our immediate surroundings to a great extent to the whole earth
- ### System
	- Something that is made from separate parts that are linked together and affect each other
- ### Society
	- A group of individuals who share common characteristics such as geographical locations, cultural background, historical timeframe, religious perspective, or value system.

## Why is the Environmental Movement so important?
### Environmental Movement
The worldwide campaign to raise awareness, and coordinate action to tackle te negative effects that humans are having on the planet.

### Significant Moments
- Environmental Disasters
- Literature
- Media
- International Agreements
- Technological Innovation

#### Gaia - James Lovelock
The Earth functions as a single organism. The book explores a hypothesis, named after the ancient Greek goddess of Earth, that the Earth works as a single entity. The Earth's living matter influences air, ocean, and rock to form a self-regulating system that has the capacity to keep the Earth a fit place for life.

### Technological Innovation
- Green Revolution
	- Refers to the time between the 1940s to 1960s when development in scientific research and technology helped with productivity in agriculture
- Other Technological innovations have been created
	- Alternative to fossil fuels

### Media
- April 22 - Earth Day
- Film/documentaries explain how earth is being affected
- Campaign groups i.e. "Save the Whale" - Greenpeace

### Inputs
- Education
- Experience
- Culture and Media
- Religious texts and doctrine
- Socio-political factors
### Outputs
- Perspective
- Decisions on how to act
- Course of action

# The Environmental Value Systems (EVS)
## Ecocentric View
- Integrates social, spiritual and environmental dimensions into a holistic ideal
- It puts *ecology and nature as central to humanity* and emphasizes a *less materialistic* approach to life with greater self-sufficiency of societies
- *Prioritizes biorights*, emphasizes the *importance of education* and encourages *self-restraint* in human behavior
- Deep ecologist - Believe that nature should just be left alone. Hold more extreme views.
- Self-reliance soft ecologists - Believe that there *is* room for some development.
> There is an intrinsic value to natural resources. Conservation of the environment is central to ecocentric values.
> Humans are *part of nature* rather than in control of it. The economy is based on *maintenance* of natural capital as there are *limited resources* and *growth needs to be controlled*. Exploitation of resources must be *sustainable* so large-scale technology should be avoided.
### Intrinsic Value
**Intrinsic Value** means the measure of what an asset, in this case natural resources, is worth financially.
Giving natural resources intrinsic value becomes troublesome in protecting or restoring ecosystems because if financial institutions don't see them as a source of profit, there is little incentive to protect and restore
*Solution: Natural environment should be valued just because it exists.*
## Anthropocentric View (Environmental Manager)
- Argues that humans must *sustainably* manage the global system
- This might be by using *taxes, environmental regulation and legislation*
- Debate would be encouraged to reach a consensual, reasonable approach to solving environmental problems
> Anthropocentrism is a human-centered worldview.
> Nature is there so that we can use its natural resources for our benefit. Economic growth and resource exploitation is acceptable as long as they're regulated by independent authorities.
## Technocentric View (Cornucopian)
- Argues that technological *developments can provide solutions* to environmental problems
- This is a consequence of a *largely optimistic* view of the role humans can play in improving the lot of humanity
- Scientific research is encouraged in order to form policies and to understand how systems can be controlled, manipulated, or changed to solve resource depletion
- A pro-growth agenda is deemed necessary for society's improvement
> Emphasizes the importance of market and economic growth.
> Has absolute faith in technology and industry. Environmental issues are not looked at as problems to be solved, but as an opportunity for science to advance and industry to increase. Technology will keep pace with environmental issues and provide solutions.
