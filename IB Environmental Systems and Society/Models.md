# What is a Model?
- A simplified version of reality and can be used to *understand how a system works* and to *predict how it will respond to change*.
- Involves some approximation and therefore loss of accuracy
- Models will have strengths and weaknesses
## Examples of Models
- **Physical**
	- Wind Tunnel
	- River
	- Volcano
- **Software**
	- Climate change
	- Evolution
	- Weather Patterns

## Strengths
- Easier to work with
- Make predictions
- See patterns
- Use in other situations
- Can be used to visualize
## Weaknesses
- Accuracy
- Wrong assumptions, wrong model
- Inaccurate predictions
