# K-Strategists
Tend to produce a small number of offspring, which increases their survival rate and enables them to survive in long-term climax communities. (Better adapted to Climax Community)
- Like humans and other large mammals
- Small numbers of offspring
- Most offspring survive
- Invest large amounts of time & energy in parental care
- Population sizes usually close to carrying capacity
- In stable, climax ecosystems, K-strategists out compete r-strategists
# r-Strategists
Are those that produce large numbers of offspring so they can colonize new habitats quickly and make use of short-lived resources (Better for Pioneer communities)
- Like invertebrates and fish
- No energy is used in raising
- Leave eggs forever after laying them
- Reproduce quickly
- Can colonize new habitats quickly
- May exceed carrying capacity because of fast reproductive rates
# Human Activity
The interference/disturbance halts the process of succession and diverts it so that a different stable state is reached rather than the climax community. This interrupted succession is known as plagioclimax.
Human activity is one factor that can divert the progression of succession to an alternative stable state by modifying the ecosystem
- Use of fire in an ecosystem
- Use of agriculture
- Grazing pressure
- Resource use, like deforestation
This diversion may be permanent depending upon the resilience of the ecosystem
An ecosystem's capacity to survive change may depend on its diversity and resilience.
# Survivorship Curves
Rates of mortality vary with age, size and sometimes gender. Survivorship curves show changes in survivorship over the lifespan of a species
Factors that influence survivorship rates include:
- Competition for resources
- Reproductive Strategy
- Adverse environmental conditions
- Predator-prey relationships
Many species lie in between these two extremes and are known as C-strategists or C-species.
K-strategists: Curve for species where almost all individuals survive for their potential life span, and then die almost simultaneously- salmon and humans are examples
r-strategists: Curve for species where most individuals die at a very young age but those that survive are likely to live for a very long time - turtles and oysters are examples.
# Production: Respiration Ratio (from 2.4)
- Early stages of a succession have low GPP but high NPP because of the low overall rates of respiration. This relationship can be described as a ration (production: respiration ratio or P/R ratio)
- If production is equal to rate of respiration, the value of P/R is 1
- Where P/R is greater than 1, biomass accumulates.
- Where P/R is less than 1, biomass is reduced.
- Where P/R = 1, a steady-state community results
In the later stages of succession, with increased consumer community, rates of community respiration are high.
Gross productivity may be high in a climax community, but as this is balanced by respiration, the net productivity approaches zero (NP = GP - respiration), and the P/R ratio approaches 1.
# P/R Ratio: Natural vs Agricultural System
- Both have low productivity at first, and biomass accumulates
- Farmers don't want P/R ratio to reach 1 because the community respiration negates the high rates of gross productivity, which means that yields are not increased. The wheat is therefore harvested before P/R = 1.
- Community respiration is also controlled in the food production system by isolating herbivores and thereby increasing net productivity and growth.
- In natural woodland, the consumer community increases, so naturally high productivity is balanced by consumption and respiration. The woodland reaches its climax community when P/R = 1 (all woodland productivity is balanced by respiration).
