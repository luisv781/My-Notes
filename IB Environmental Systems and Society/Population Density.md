Population Density: Total number of species in all quadrats / area of one quadrat * total number of quadrats
# Percentage Cover 
- Plant abundance is best estimated using percentage cover
- Percentage cover is the percentage of the area within the quadrat covered by one particular species 
- Method not suitable for mobile organisms
- Example on right: Dividing the quadrat into a 10 x 10 grid (100 squares) helps to estimate percentage cover (each square is 1 percent of the total area cover)
# Percentage Frequency 
- Percentage frequency is the number of actual occurrences divided by the number of possible occurrences, expressed as a percentage.
- Example #1 if a plant occurs in 7 out of 100 squares in a grid quadrat, its percentage frequency would be 7%
- Example #2 If 8 quadrats out of 10 contained yellow-horned poppy on a transect across a shingler ridge their percentage frequency would be 80% (not individual squares in quadrat the whole thing)
# Methods for Estimating Biomass of Trophic Levels 
- To obtain quantitative samples of biomass biological material is dried to constant weight.
- The specimens are put in hot oven (not hot enough to burn tissue) - around 80C (176 F) - and left for a specific length of time.
- The specimen is reweighed and replaced in the oven.
- This is repeated until a similar mass is obtained on two successive weighing (i.e no further loss in mass is recorded as no further water is present.)
- Biomass is usually stated per unit area so that comparisons can be made between trophic levels. (per meter squared)
- Biomass productivity is given as mass per unit area per period of time (usually per year)
### Example - Estimating Biomass of Primary Producer
- Collect all the vegetation (including roots, stems, and leaves) within a series of 1 m by 1m squadrats
- Then carry out the dry-weight method (previous slide), then Average biomass can then be calculated.
- Once dry biomass has been obtained, combustion of samples under controlled conditions give quantitative data about the amount of energy contained per unit sample (e.g  per gram) in material
- Organic matter can be burned in a calorimeter, where the heat released during combustion is measured to determine the energy content
- Extrapolate by estimating the total biomass of organisms and multiplying this by the energy content per unit mass, this can be indicate the total energy per trophic level in an ecosystem
- Using data can help with making a pyramid of productivity
## Calorimeter
- Used to calculate the energy content of biomass
- Issues with this method for determining biomass
	- Killing organisms
	- Can't measure biomass of large plants
	- Can be difficult to measure roots since its buried
# Species Richness and Diversity
- Species diversity is considered as a function of two components:
	- The number of different species
	- The relative numbers of individuals of each species.
- Species richness - the number of species in an area
- To quantify species diversity, you need to use Simpson’s Diversity Index 
- Simpson’s Diversity Index can be used for both animals and plant communities’
# Simpson Diversity Index
- To make sure you have sampled all the species in your ecosystem, perform a cumulative species count
- As more quadrats are added to sample size, any additional species are noted and added to species richness
- The point at which the graph levels off gives you the best estimate of the number of species in your ecosystem.
- The higher the result (D) the greater the species diversity, lower D value lower diversity. Similar habitats can be compared using D; a lower value in one habitat may indicate human impact. Low values of D in the arctic tundra however, may represent stable and ancient sites,
- This indication of diversity is only useful when comparing two similar habitats, or the same habitat over time with the same type of organisms.
- However, it is also possible that certain habitats are not been sampled and species missed
- Communities with one dominant species have a low diversity
$$
D=\frac{N(N-1)}{\sum n(n-1)}
$$
D is the Simpson diversity index
N is the total number of organism of all species found n is the number of individuals of a particular species.
$\sum$ represents change.
If its asking for diversity of an area for a species, only do N(N-1) If its asking for 
Top Number is the total population of what you found
Divided By 
Diversity is found with both functions, one divided by the other. 
Solve the function for every species individually, and add them together to. Next, divide it by the top half of the equation. The top half of the equation is the total population used to find the D. 

Once you have that number, divide it by the number at the bottom. (the numbers that added together deriving from n(n-1) for EVERY species in the graph. n Represents the number of that specific species, while N represents the total population that will be inputted into N(N-1)
You have to do it individually for every species, when you’re finding for the thing where it asks for sigma.
### Simpson Diversity Index: Comparing “D” Values
The woodland with D = 3.28 could be an undisturbed ecosystem
The other woodland with D = 1.48 could be a disturbed ecosystem A high value D suggests a stable and stable site, and a low value D suggests suggests pollution or agricultural management.
