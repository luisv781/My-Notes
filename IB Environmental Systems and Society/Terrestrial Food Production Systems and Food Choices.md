# Efficiency of Terrestrial Production Systems
- The yield of food per unit area from lower trophic levels is greater in quantity, lower in cost, and requires less resources than the higher trophic levels
- In terrestrial systems, most food is harvested from relatively low trophic levels (producers and herbivores)
- Systems that produce crops are more energy efficient than those that produce livestock, because crops are producers and have more energy.
# Cultural Choices
- Cultural choices may influence societies to harvest food from higher trophic levels (meat and dairy)
- Some cultures use livestock as working animals, while in other places they are only viewed a food (source of protein)
# Inputs, Outputs, and Environmental Impacts of Terrestrial Food Production Systems
- Inputs include
	- fertilizers (artificial or organic)
	- water (irrigation or rainfall)
	- pest-control (pesticides or natural predators)
	- labor (mechanized and fossil-fuel dependent or physical labor)
	- seeds (genetically modified or conventional)
	- breeding stock (domestic or wild)
	- livestock growth promoters (antibiotics or hormones versus organic or none)
- Outputs include
	- food quality and quantity
	- pollutants (air, soil, water)
	- consumer health
	- soil quality (erosion, degradation, fertility)
	- common pollutants released from food production systems include fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides, antibiotics, hormones and gases from the use of fossil fuels
	- transportation, processing, and packaging of food (leading to further pollution from fossil fuels).
- System characteristics include diversity (monoculture vs polyculture)
- Terrestrial farming systems can be divided into several types
	- Commercial farming- farming for profit, often of a single crop
	- Subsistence farming produces only enough to feed the farmer and their family, with none to sell for profit
- Both commercial and subsistence farming can be either intensive or extensive
	- Intensive farms generally take up a small area of land but aim to have very high output per unit area of land
	- Extensive farms are large in comparison to the money and labor put into them
- The environmental impacts of food production systems include:
	- Soil degradation from erosion
	- Desertification
	- Eutrophication from agricultural run-off
	- Pollution from insecticides, pesticides, and fertilizers
	- Salinization from over-irrigation
	- Lowered water tables and over-abstraction of ground water
	- Loss of valuable habitats (e.g. wetlands drained for agriculture)
	- Disease epidemics from high-density livestock farming and monoculture
# Increasing Sustainability
- Increased sustainability may be achieved through
	- Altering human activity to *reduce meat consumption*
	- Increasing consumption of *organically grown, seasonal, and locally produced* food products
	- Planting of *buffer zones* (areas of land containing native vegetation that are adjacent to or surround agricultural land)
	- *Improving the accuracy of food labels* to assist consumers in making informed food choices
	- Monitoring and control of the standards and practices of multinational and national food corporations by governmental and intergovernmental bodies
