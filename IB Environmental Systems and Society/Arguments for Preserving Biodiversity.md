- Arguments about species and habitat preservation can be based on
	- aesthetic
	- ecological
	- economic
	- ethical and social justifications
- Aesthetic reasons
	- Species and habitats are *pleasant to look at and provide beauty and inspiration.*
- Ecological reasons
	- Rare habitats contain *endemic species* that require specific habitats. Healthy ecosystems provide ecosystem services like *pollination and flood prevention*. Species need to be preserved because *if they disappear, they could have effects on the ecosystem*.
- Economic reasons:
	- Economic arguments for preservation often involve valuation of *ecotourism*, the *genetic resource*, and commercial considerations of the *natural capital*.
- Ethical reasons
	- Ethical reasons also include the idea that every species has a right to survive. Ethical arguments are broad, and include the intrinsic value of the species or the usefulness of species
- Social reasons
	- Many ecosystems around the world provide places to live for indigenous peoples. Loss of these areas would mean loss of these peoples' homes, source of livelihood, and culture. Ecosystems can provide an income for local people, such as *tourism* and *wildlife protection*.
# Conservation Organizations
- International, governmental, intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are involved in conserving and restoring ecosystems and biodiversity, with varying levels of effectiveness due to their use of:
	- media
	- speed of response
	- diplomatic constraints
	- financial resources
	- political influence
- NGOs are not run by, funded by, or influenced by governments of any country. Ex: World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)
- IGOs are bodies established through international agreements to protect the environment and bring together governments to work together. Ex: United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
# IGO vs NGO
## Intergovernmental Organization
- More conservative. Tend to have a *more conventional approach* to conservation and are not likely to be controversial
- Gather information from scientific research which they pay for
## Non-governmental Organization
- More "radical" and often have to be to get their message across and to be heard
- Field based, gathering information to back up their arguments
# Biodiversity Conservation
- Recent international conventions on biodiversity work to create collaboration between nations for biodiversity conservation.
- Conservation approaches include
	- Habitat conservation
	- Species-based conservation
	- Mixed approach
- There are different strategies for conservation
	- In situ conservation preserves biodiversity in natural habitats (protected areas, safari parks)
	- Ex situ conservation preserved biodiversity outside natural habitats (zoos)
- The species-based approach to conservation is an approach that focuses on specific individual species (usually animals) that are vulnerable
## Protected Areas
- Cities set aside protected land aside for species. They become like "islands" and lose their diversity due to edge effects and local extinctions
- Edge effects: impact of changed environmental conditions at the edge of the reserves
- Criteria for consideration when designing protected areas include
	- Size
	- Shape
	- Edge effects
	- Corridors
	- Proximity to potential human influence
