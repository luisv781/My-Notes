# Criteria for Designing Conservations
Size
- There are either a single large reserve or several small ones.
- The option that is chose depends on habitat location
	- Several small ones are chosen if habitats preserved are not near each other
	- Bigger is better because one large area can support more species
Edge Effects
- It's the impact of changed environmental conditions at the edge of the reserves
- There are changes in abiotic factors like more wind, or warmer and less humid conditions compared to central part of reserve
- The edge effects also attract species from outside the reserve
Shape
- The best shape for reserves are circles because it has the low edge effects.
- Long & thin (rectangular) reserves have large edge effects.
- The shape is determined by what is available and where the habitats to be conserved are located.
Corridors (linking reserves)
- Benefits: Allows gene flow by immigration/emigration and reduces collisions between cars and animals
- Disadvantages: species may breed outside reserve leading to reduction in numbers, invasion of exotic pests or disease, easy poacher movement, narrow corridors, obstructions to corridors
Proximity to human influence (buffer zone)
- Areas around conservation areas
- These areas minimize disturbance from outside influences such as
	- people
	- agriculture
	- invasion by disease or pests
# Species-based Conservation Strategies
- Alternative approaches to the development of protected areas are species based conservation strategies including;
	- CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species)
	- Captive breeding and reintroduction programs, and zoos
	- Selection of "charismatic" species to help protect others in an area (flagship species)
	- Selection of keystone species to protect the integrity of the food web
- **Keystone species** are species that are vital for the continuing function of the ecosystem: without them the ecosystem may collapse. (African elephant and gray wolves)
- **Flagship species** are 'charismatic' species selected to appeal to the public and thereby help to protect other species in an area (giant panda, meerkats, gorillas)
# Successful Conservation Efforts
- What influences the success of conservation efforts
	- Community support
	- Adequate funding
	- Proper research influences the success of conservation efforts
- The location of a conservation area in a country is a significant factor in the success of the conservation effort.
- Surrounding land use for the conservation area and distance from urban centers are important factors for consideration in conservation area design.
# Economic/Ecologic/Ethical Reasons
- Economic arguments for preservation often involve valuation of ecotourism, of the genetic resource, and commercial considerations of the natural capital.
- Ecological reasons may be related to the ecosystem.
- Ethical arguments are very broad and can include the essential value of the species or the practical value.
