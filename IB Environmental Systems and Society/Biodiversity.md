- Biodiversity arises from evolutionary processes
- Biodiversity encompasses:
	- Variety of organisms in a given area
	- Genetic variation within a population
	- Variety of species in a community
	- Variety of communities in an ecosystem
- Evolution
	- The development of new species over very long periods of geological time (millions of years)
- Biological Variation:
	- Arises randomly and can be:
		- Beneficial (helps with survival)
		- Damaging (hinders survival)
		- Neutral (no impact on survival)
# Natural Selection
- Natural selection is an evolutionary driving force, sometimes called "surival of the fittest"
- "fittest" is understood to be "best-suited to the niche"
- Organisms that had genetic traits that allowed them to survive and reproduce are considered the strongest
- Charles Darwin, a British researcher, produced the term "natural selection" in the 1830's from his studies in the Galapagos islands
- Natural selection means "nature chooses". It is the opposite of artificial selection or selective breeding.
- The process of natural selection contributes to the evolution of biodiversity over time.
## Natural Selection Mechanism
Natural selection occurs through the following mechanism.
1. Within a population of one species, there is genetic diversity, which is called variation.
2. Due to natural variation, some individuals will be fitter than others.
3. Fitter individuals have an advantage and will reproduce more successfully than individuals who are less fit.
4. The offspring of fitter individuals may inherit the genes that give that advantage
Thus, natural selection will contribute to the evolution of biodiversity over time.
# Environmental Change and Survival of the Fittest
- Environmental change gives new challenges to species:
	- Those that are suited and able to adapt will survive
	- Those that are not suited and not able to adapt won't survive
# Speciation
- Speciation is the formation of new species when populations of a species become isolated and evolve differently from other populations.
- Isolation of populations can be caused by environmental changes forming barriers such as:
	- Mountain formation
	- Changes in rivers
	- Island formation
	- Sea level change
	- Climatic change
	- Plate movements
## Geographical Isolation
- This is essential for formation of new species
- Without it, interbreeding would cause the genes from two populations to continue to mix
## Tectonic Plate Movements
- The surface of the Earth is divided into crustal, tectonic plates that have moved throughout geological time
- The tectonic plates are located on the lithosphere (crust/upper mantle) layer of Earth
- Tectonic plates can separate, collide, and slip past each other. This can cause Earthquakes ,Volcanic Eruptions and create Mountains
- This has led to the creation of both land bridges and physical barriers with evolutionary consequences
- The distribution of continents has also caused climatic variations and variation in food supply, both contributing to evolution
