# Access to Freshwater
- The average person in the US uses about 80-100 gallons of water per day.
- In 2015, the US used 322 billion gallons of water per day
	- Irrigation (118 Bgal/day)
	- Thermoelectric power (133 Bgal/day)
	- Public supply (39 Bgal/day)
- These 3 categories account for 90% of the national total
- More than 1 billion people in developing nations don't have access to safe drinking water and 2 billion are without adequate sanitation
- 840k+ people die each year from water-related diseases
- 80%+ of sewage in developing countries is discharged untreated, polluting rivers, lakes, and coastal areas.
# Climate Change May Disrupt Rainfall Patterns
Temperature and moisture are among the key variables that determine
- Distribution of water
- Growth and productivity
- Reproduction of plants and animals
Changes in climate are expected in the coming decades and will have diverse effects on moisture availability
- Ranging from alterations in the timing and volume of streamflow
- To the lowering of water levels in many wetlands
- The expansion of thermokarst lakes in the Arctic due to warmer summers (lakes from melted permafrost)
- Warming water temperatures
- Rainforests will lose ability to generate its own rain due to climate change
# Demand of Freshwater Increases
- The demand for freshwater increases as populations, irrigation and industrialization increase.
- The water cycle gives us fresh water but too much water from underground aquifers is being used. We are not giving time for these aquifers to be replenished
- The demand of water has increased in both MEDCs and LEDCs, as populations are increasing as well as agriculture changing and expanding industry
- MEDCs are using more freshwater than LEDCs
- Increased demand in LEDCs is due to
	- Expanding populations
	- Rising standards of living
	- Changing agricultural practice
	- Expanding industry
- Existing water resources therefore need to be managed and controlled more carefully, and new water resources found

# Freshwater supplies limited due to contamination and extraction
- Humans need potable water to drink, otherwise we can get sick
- Untreated water carries diseases like cholera, dysentery, Hep A, typhoid and polio
- Climate change is causing more droughts, sever hurricanes, and floods
- Droughts have serious effects on agriculture, livestock and water supplies, causing famine, malnutrition and the displacement of populations
# Enhancing Water Supplies
- To meet increased demands, water resource management practitioners are expanding the limited natural water supplies with:
	- Desalination
	- Reusing wastewater
	- Enhanced groundwater recharge (canals, injection wells)
	- Diverting surface water to underground to reduce loss from evaporation
	- Dams and reservoirs to store water
	- Educating public about conserving water
	- Covering expanses of water with plastic to reduce evaporation
# Enhancing Water Supplies in Agriculture
- Using drought resistant crops to reduce watering (Black Beans, Oregano, Basil)
- Using drip irrigation to water crops
- Organic fertilizers cause less pollution and bio-control measures an be used to reduce crop pests
# Managing Freshwater in Residential Setting
Examples of different ways to conserve and manage water:
- Building water efficient buildings (using rainwater for sanitation/showers, reusing "gray water" from handwashing or showering)
- Homes using more water-efficient appliances (dishwasher/toilets/washer)
- Expand metering to encourage households to use water more efficiently
- Rain water harvesting
# Drip Irrigation
- Drip (trickle flow) irrigation is a system of plastic tubes installed at or just below the soil surface to deliver water to individual plants
- The water, which can be enhanced with fertilizer, is delivered to the roots of plants, so that there is very little lost to evaporation.
- Drip irrigation can achieve as high as 95% efficiency
- Superior than flooding fields & overhead sprinklers
# Consequences of Lack of Freshwater
- The increased demand for water and lack of it can lead to unequal distribution and geo-political issues
- When water supplies fail, populations will be forced to relocate in vast numbers. Failed crops. Civil unrest and war can also happen
- Examples of disputes/conflict over water include:
	- Syria, Iraq and Turkey disputing over Euphrates and Tigris Rivers
	- Conflict for Jordan River between Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine
## Due to Population Rising
- India has 4% of the world's freshwater, but 16% of its population:
	- Demand will probably exceed supply by 2020(happening now) from growing population in cities and growing industries
	- Groundwater reserves are drying up due to India's +27 million wells extracting water crops.
	- Not allowing aquifers to recharge to original levels
