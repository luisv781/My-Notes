## Vocabulary
- **Species** - A group of organisms that share common characteristics, can reproduce with each other and can produce fertile offspring
- **Population** - A group of organisms of the same species that live in the same area
- **Habitat** - The environment in which a species normally lives
- **Niche** - The set of abiotic and biotic conditions and resources that an organism responds to
	- **Fundamental Niche** - The *full range* of conditions and resources in which a species could survive and reproduce
	- **Realized Niche** - The *actual* conditions and resources in which a species exists 
- **Limiting Factors** - Factors that slow down growth of a population as it reaches its carrying capacity
- **Carrying Capacity** - The maximum number of species that can be sustainably supported by an area.
# What is what in Ecology?
- Ecosystems are made up of organisms and the physical environment between - 
	- Living (biotic)
	- Non-living (abiotic) components
## Species
A species is a *group of organisms* that share *common characteristics* and that interbreed to produce fertile offspring
- If a barrier occurs, **speciation** will occur
	- Two different species from the same genus
		- horses
		- donkeys
			- The two can mate but will produce a sterile offspring
## Population
A group of organisms of the same species living in the same area at the same time, and which are capable of interbreeding
**Population Density** is the *average number of individuals* in a stated area
**Population Size** is the number of individuals in an area
	Can be affected by three factors: natality (birth rate), mortality, and migration
## Habitat
A **habitat** is the environment in which a species normally lives. The habitat of the African elephant, for example, includes savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes.
## Niche
A **niche** describes the set of abiotic and biotic *conditions and resources* to which an organism or population responds.
An **ecological niche** is best described as where, when, and how an organism lives. An organism's niche depends not only on where it lives (its habitat) but also on what it does.
## Carrying Capacity
**Carrying capacity** describes the maximum number of individuals of a species that can be sustained by an environment
**Limiting factors** will *slow* population growth as it approaches the carrying capacity of the system
- Animals: space, food, mates, nesting sites, water
- Plants: light, nutrients, water, carbon dioxide, and temperature
- Both: disease, predation
## Biotic Factors
The *living parts* of the ecosystem, the organisms that live within it, are termed biotic factors.
- Also, the interactions between the organisms--such as predation, herbivory, parasitism, mutualism, disease, and competition--are termed biotic factors
## Abiotic Factors
Is the *non-living physical factors* that influence the organism and ecosystem
- Examples are temperature, sunlight, pH, salinity, and pollution
# Population Interactions
## Tolerance Limits
An upper level or lower level of environmental factors beyond which a population can not survive. There is an optimal range.
## Predation (Interactions Relating to Biotic Factors)
**Predation** occurs when one animal (or a plant like the Venus Flytrap) *hunts and eats another organism*.
Examples -
- Lion eating a Zebra
- Killer Whale eating a Seal
- Cheetah eating Impala
Populations *depend on each other*. When a predator increases, the prey will decrease. When the prey decreases, the predator decreases as well. When the predator decreases, the prey will increase. They work together vice versa and depend on each other in order to make an endless cycle.
Predator prey interactions are often controlled by a *negative feedback loop* in which the predators and prey are kept in *balance*.
## Herbivory
**Herbivory** is an interaction where an animal feeds on a plant. The animal that eats the plant is called a herbivore.
Examples -
- Hippos eat vegetation on the land during the coolness of the night.
- Cows eating grass.
The carrying capacity of the herbivoreâ€™s environment is affected by the quantity of the plant it feeds on.
An area with *more abundant plant resources* has a *higher carrying capacity* than an area that has less plant material available as food for the herbivore.
## Parasitism
A **parasite** is an organism that benefits at the expense of another from which it derives food. One species benefits at the expense of others.
There are two types of parasites -
- **Ectoparasites** : live on the surface of their host (ticks and mites)
- **Endoparasites** : live inside their host (tapeworms)
The carrying capacity of the host is bad because it is destructive towards it.
## Mutualism
**Mutualism** is a relationship between two species in which *both of them benefit*.
Example -
- The aphids secrete a sugar solution called honeydew.
- Ants drink the honeydew and, in return, they protect the aphids from predators.
## Disease
An organism that causes disease is known as a **pathogen**. Pathogens include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and single-celled animals called protozoa.
The disease-causing species may *reduce the carrying capacity* of the organism it is infecting.
Examples -
- Covid-19
- Flu
- Dutch elm disease (fungus)
## Competition
**Competition** is the relationship between two organisms that *attempt to use the same limited resource* such that *both are negatively affected* by the relationship.
Two types of competition -
- **Intraspecific Competition** : within the *same species*
- **Interspecific Competition** : with individuals of *different species*
**Competitive exclusion** : When one of two species occupying similar niches *totally out-competes* the other.
