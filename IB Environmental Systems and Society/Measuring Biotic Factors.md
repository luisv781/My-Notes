# Measuring Biotic Components of the Ecosystem
- Now let's consider the biotic or living factors in an ecosystem
- Remember: You must follow the IB ethical practice guidelines and IB animal experimentation policy. Meaning, animals and the environment should not be harmed during your work. It is not possible to study every organism in an ecosystem, so limitations are put on how many plants and animals are studied
- Trapping methods enable limited samples to be taken:
	- Trapping methods for mobile
	- Trapping methods for non-mobile samples
## Mobile organisms
- Trapping methods for organisms that can move around (are motile/mobile) include:
	- pitfall traps - beakers or pots buried in the soil which animals walk into and cannot escape from
	- nets - sweep, butterfly, seine, and purse
	- flight interception traps - often baited, with a door thar closes once an animal is inside (Longworth trap)
	- light traps - a UV bulb against a white sheet attracts certain night flying insects
	- Tullgren funnels - paired cloth funnels, with a light source at one end, a sample pot the other, and a wire mesh between: invertebrates in soil samples placed on the mesh move away from the heat at the lamp and fall into the collecting bottle at the bottom
## Non-mobile organisms
- Trapping methods for organisms that cannot move around (are non-motile) or have limited movement:
	- Quadrats - square frames of different sizes depending on the sample area being studied; frames can be divided into grids of smaller squares to more easily quantify the numbers of organisms present
# Abundance
- Abundance refers to the relative representation of a species in an ecosystem.
- You can work out the number or abundance of organisms in various ways
	- By directly counting the number or percentage cover of organisms in a selected area (for organisms that do not move or are limited in movement)
	- By indirectly calculating abundance using a formula such as the Lincoln index (for animals that are motile)
