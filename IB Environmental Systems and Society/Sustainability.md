# What is Sustainability?
The use and management of resources that allows *full natural replacement* of the resources used and recovery of the ecosystems affected by their extraction and use.
"Living within the means of nature"
There is a finite amount of material on Earth and most humans are using much of it unsustainably.
Example of being sustainable: Circular Economy! Literally reusing and repurposing all resources.

# What are Indicators of Sustainability?
- Ecological and Socio-Economic
	- Air quality
	- Environmental Vulnerability
	- Water poverty
	- GDP per capita
	- Life expectancy
Can be measured from local to global scale. Smaller the scale, the more accurate it can be.
# What is Sustainability Development?
Development that has met the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
# Natural Capital vs. Natural Income
## Natural Capital
- **Natural capital** is a term used for *natural resources* that can produce a *sustainable natural income* of goods or services.
- Example: Forests are "Natural Capital"
- It can provide services: erosion control, water management, recycling waste
## Natural Income
- **Natural income** is the yield(money) obtained from natural resources.
- Examples: Timber, from forests, is "Natural Income"
