# Tricellular Model
The tricellular model of atmospheric circulation explains the distribution of precipitation and temperature and how they influence structure and relative productivity of different terrestrial biomes.
The tricellular model of atmospheric circulation is a way of explaining differences in atmospheric pressure belts, temperature, and precipitation that exist across the globe.

The tricellular model is made up of the polar cell, the Ferrel cell in mid-latitudes, and the Hadley cell in the tropics.
Downward air movement creates high pressure (dry air, desert). Upward air movement creates low pressure and cooling air that leads to increased cloud formation and precipitation.
# Forest Biomes
## Tropical Rain Forests
- High temperatures and rainfall
- Very high diversity of animals and plants
- The high diversity of plants is because of the high levels of productivity resulting from year-round high rainfall and insolation
- Located around the equator within the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. They experience high light levels throughout the year
- Position enables high levels of photosynthesis and high rates of NPP throughout the year. (NPP = GPP - R)
- Tropical rainforests are estimated to produce 40% of NPP of terrestrial ecosystems
- The soil is low in nutrients. Nutrients are in the plants.
- Soils in rainforest are thin. Tress have shallow root systems plus wide buttresses for support.
### Tropical Rain Forest Canopy
- Emergent trees can be up to 80m high
- Only about 1% of light hitting the canopy layer reaches the floor
- Highest levels of NPP are found in the canopy - one of the most productive areas of vegetation in the world
- High productivity in the canopy results in high biodiversity, and it is believed that half of the world's species could be found in rainforest canopies.
## Temperate Forests
- Temperate forests are largely found between the 40 and 60 degree north of the equator.
- Winters are cold. Summers are warm.
- Two different tree types are found in temperate forests: evergreen (which has leaves all year round) and deciduous (which lose their leaves in the winter)
- Rainfall in these biomes is between 500 and 1500 mm per year
- The mild climate, with lower average temperatures and lower rainfall also *reduces levels of photosynthesis and productivity*
- Diversity is lower than in rainforests and the structure of temperate forests is simpler
- Less niches, less species diversity
- Lower and less dense canopy means that *light levels on the forest floor are higher than in rainforests*, so the shrub layer can contain many plants
# Desert Biomes
- Deserts are found in bands at latitudes of approximately 30N and S
- Latitudes that dry air descends having lost water vapor over the tropics
- Hot deserts are characterized by high temperatures at the warmest time of day in early afternoon and low precipitation
- Organisms also have to overcome fluctuations in temperature (night temperatures, when skies are clear, can be as low as 10C, sometimes as low as 0C)
- The lack of water limits rates of photosynthesis and so rates of NPP are very low.
- Decomposition levels are low because of the dryness of the air and lack of water
- Plants adapted to store large amounts of water and have root systems to capture the most water during rain (cacti)
- Animals like snakes are highly adapted to conserve water and their coldblooded metabolism is ideally suited to desert conditions
# Tundra Biomes
- At high latitudes where insolation is low
- Water in ice for months and little rain is a limiting factor
- Low light intensity and rainfall means that rates of photosynthesis and productivity are low
- Temperature is also a limiting factor because it affects the rate of photosynthesis, respiration, and decomposition
- Soil may be permanently frozen (permafrost) and nutrients are limiting
- Most of the world's tundra is found in the north polar region
- During winter months, temperatures can reach -50C. All life activity is low.
- In summer, the sun is out almost 24 hours a day, so levels of insolation and temperature both increase leading to plant growth and animal activity.
# Grassland Biomes
- Found on every continent except Antarctica, and cover about 16% of the Earth
- Types of grassland: the Great Plains and the Russian Steppes are temperate grasslands; the savannahs of east Africa are tropical grassland.
- Rainfall is approximately in balance with levels of evaporation
- Rainfall is between a forest and desert biome
- Grasses grow beneath the surface and during cold periods can remain dormant until the ground warms
- Found in the area where the polar and Ferrel cells meet.
# Aquatic Biomes
## Tropical Coral Reef
- Rainforests of the ocean
- Have high biodiversity and many niches
- Coral reefs are located near the equator where seas are warm and there is strong sunlight throughout the year
- Polyps take carbon dioxide and calcium from seawater and transform it into calcium carbonate skeletons, which form the reef
- Warm sea temperatures cause productivity of algae that live within the polyps to high, means production of new coral skeletons can also be high
- Input of energy from the sun via algae, and other producers like seaweeds, provides a constant input of energy into the ecosystem, maintaining complex food webs.
