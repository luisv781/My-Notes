- Soil system storages include organic matter, organisms, nutrients, minerals, air, and water.
- Soils are a major component of the world's ecosystems
- Soils form at the boundary of Earth's atmosphere, lithosphere (rocks), biosphere (living matter) and hydrosphere (water)
- Soils form the outermost layer of the Earth's surface, and comprise weathered bedrock organic matter (both dead and alive), air, and water
# Soils support our planet's biodiversity
- Medium for plant growth
- Contain 0.0005% of the global freshwater
- Filter materials added to the soil thereby maintaining water quality
- Some recycling of nutrients takes place in the soil through the breakdown of dead organic matter
- Soil acts as a habitat for billions of microorganisms as well as for some animals. (groundhogs and moles)
- Soils provide raw materials in the form of peat, clays, sands, gravels, and minerals
# Soil-Forming Processes
- Soil is a nonrenewable resource, because the current rate of resource use compared to the length of time required for resource replacement
- Soil-forming processes involve:
	- gains and losses of material to and from the profile
	- movement of water
	- chemical transformations
- Soils must be considered open systems in a steady-state equilibrium, varying constantly as factors and processes that influence them change
- The principal soil-forming professes include weathering, transfer of materials, organic changes, and waterlogging
- The weathering of bedrock gives the soil its C horizon and its initial bases and nutrients (fertility), structure, and texture (drainage).
# Gains and losses of material
- Transfers of materials within the soil contribute to the organization of the soil
- Inputs include organic material (leaf litter) and inorganic matter from parent material(rocks), precipitation and energy
- Outputs include energy, uptake by plants, and soil erosion
# Movement of Water
- Soils can store and filter water, improving a land's flood and drought resistance
- Translocation includes many processes, mostly by water and mostly downwards
- Leaching refers to the downward movement of soluble material
- Transfers of materials include biological mixing and leaching (minerals dissolved in water moving through soil), which contribute to the organization of the soil.
- In arid and semi-arid environments, evapotranspiration (EVT) is greater than precipitation, so the movement of soil solution is upwards through the soil. Water is drawn towards surface (capillary action)
- So, leaching doesn't happen unless there is a storm and calcium carbonate and other solutes remain in the soil. This is called Calcification
- Intense EVT  causes Na or C to be drawn up from the soil and form crust in the surface. Toxic for plants.
- Excessive sodium concentrations may happen due to capillary rise of water from a water table tat is saline and close to surface. This is known as salinization or alkalization.
# Chemical Transformations
## Decomposition
- Plant litter is decomposed (humified) into a dark mass called humus
- Decomposers(Fungi and bacteria) and detritivores (insects and worms) further decompose plant litter
## Weathering
- Weathering is the decomposition and disintegration of rocks
- There is chemical (altered rock substances), mechanical (fragmented rocks), biological (animals/plants alter and break rock) and weathering
- With the help of plants and animals, air and water, altered/broken rocks (regolith) help form soil
## Nutrient Cycling
- Involves interaction between soil, plants, animals, and the atmosphere, and many food chains
- Nutrients are circulated and reused frequently
- All natural elements are capable of being absorbed by plants, either as gases or soluble salts
- Macronutrients: Oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen (needed in large quantities)
- Trace elements: Magnesium, sulfur, phosphorus (small doses)
- Nutrients are taken in by plants and built into new organic matter
- When animals eat the plants, they take up the nutrients
- The nutrients eventually return to the soil from the plants and animals dying or by animal feces and are broken down by decomposers

- Soils in tropical areas such as Borneo, Indonesia may be extremely deep due to the warm, wet year-round climate
- In contrast, soils in cold areas, such as Iceland, may be very thin or non-existent, due to the lack of chemical weathering
# Soil Structure and Properties
- Soils provide plants with several benefits. These include:
	- anchorage for roots
	- a supply of water
	- a supply of oxygen
	- a supply of mineral nutrients 9nitrogen)
	- protection against adverse changes of temperature and pH
- There are several soil conditions that restrict root growth. These are a mix of physical and chemical conditions.
- Physical conditions include:
	- mechanical barriers (compacted soil)
	- absence of cracks
	- shortage of oxygen due to waterlogging (soil is too wet)
	- dryness
	- temperatures that are too high or too low
- Chemical conditions include:
	- High aluminum concentration, usually associated with low pH and low nutrient supply
	- Phytotoxic chemicals in anaerobic soil (trace metals or salinity associated with insecticides or herbicides)
## Soil Structure
- Soil structure refers to the shape and arrangement of individual soil particles
- Ideal soil for cultivation is a loam in which there is a balance between water holding ability and freely draining, aerated conditions.
- Loam is a well-balanced soil with significant proportions of sand, silt, and clay.
## Soil Texture
- Soil texture refers to the proportion of differently used materials - usually sand, silt, and clay - present in a soil.
- A soil texture triangle illustrates the differences in composition of soils
## Soil Types
- The agricultural potential of a soil depends on:
	- The porosity and permeability of the soil
	- The surface area of the soil peds (particles)
# Drainage and Water Holding Capacity
- The pore spaces in soil determine the rate at which water drains through a soil
- Example: heavy clay soil can hold 2x as much water as a light soil. Light soils (over 80% sand) are coarse textured and area easily drained of water and nutrients
- Heavy soils with 25% clay and have fine-textured particles are water and nutrient retentive
- Silt particles are larger than clay and smaller than sand. Thus, silt drains faster than clay but more slowly than sand. It does not retain water or chemicals well, so its potential for farming is reduced. 
# Primary Productivity
- Primary productivity of soil depends on: mineral content, drainage, water-holding capacity, air spaces
# International Mindedness
- Significant differences exist in arable (potential to promote primary productivity) soil availability around the world. These differences have sociopolitical, economic and ecological influences.
