- Many people in LEDCs are suffering from undernourishment or malnutrition
- *Undernourishment*: food intake doesn't contain enough energy
- *Malnutrition*: food intake lacks essential nutrients such as protein and minerals
- About 690 million people globally are undernourished
- MEDCs have surplus of food, with markets producing too much food for the population to consume
- Import tariffs imposed by MEDCs make the import of food more expensive, which can affect exporting countries because it will cause some consumers to look elsewhere for a cheaper item
- Tariffs are taxes imposed on products exported from other countries
- For example, the US started charging tariffs on some items that China shipped here. So, items from China that were sold here will cost more due to this tariff (tax), it affects China because consumers here will buy less of their product
## MEDCs
- More technocentric with high yields
- Food production involves high levels of tech, low labor, and high fuel costs
- Fertilizer & pesticides are factory produced
- Product processing and packaging is on a large scale
- Have large monocultures
## LEDCs
- Low levels of tech, lack of capital, and uses high levels of labor
- Dependence on working animals rather than machinery, making it a labor-intensive process
- Mixed cropping on a small scale is common in LEDCs
# Food Waste
- Food waste occurs in both LEDCs and MEDCs, but for different reasons
- About 50% of food produced in the world, which like 2.2 billion tons, ends up as waste
- Reasons for food waste:
	- Poor agricultural practices
	- Inadequate infrastructure when transporting food
	- Poor storage facilities
	- Strict sell by dates on supermarket food
	- Buy one get one free promotions on food in supermarkets
	- Western consumer demand for food that appears perfect (free from deformities)
## LEDCs
- In LEDCs, such as those of sub-Saharan Africa and SE Asia, wastage tends to occur primarily at the *farmer-producer* end of the supply chain.
- Causes:
	- Inefficient harvesting
	- Inadequate local transportation
	- Poor infrastructure
	- Poor storage conditions
## MEDCs
- Mold and pests destroy or degrade large quantities of food material
- Food stuffs can spill from badly maintained vehicles or are bruised as vehicles travel over poorly maintained roads
- For example, in Vietnam rice losses are around 80% of all production and China is about 45%.
- Efficient farming practices, better transport, storage, and processing facilities --> more food produced reaches markets and consumers
- Food waste through retail and customer behavior
- For example, major supermarkets, often reject entire crops of perfectly edible fruit and vegetables because they don't meet marketing standards for their physical characteristics, such as size and appearance
- Globally, retailers generate 1.6 million tons of food waste annually
- Promotions frequently encourage customers to purchase excessive quantities and generates wastage in the home
- Overall, 30-50% of what has been bought in MEDCs is thrown away by the purchaser.
- The amount of food that goes to waste globally is worth about $250 billion yearly (in MEDCs)
# Links between social and food production systems
- Socio-economic, cultural, ecological, political, and economic factors can be seen to influence societies in their choices of food production systems.
- Socio-economic factors in terrestrial food production include farming for: profit, subsistence, export/local consumption, quantity or quality, commercial farming
- People who live in close connection with nature, such as shifting cultivators in the Brazilian Amazon, show a closer connection between social systems and ecological systems (ecocentric approach) than societies living away in cities
- Urban capitalist elites in Brazil are more likely to view the rainforest as a resource for development and cash (technocentric approach)
- The lack of understanding of people disconnected from nature makes them more likely to make decisions that produce wasteful and damaging actions, such as the construction of dams and whole-scale clearance of forest for timber or cattle ranching
- Socio-cultural factors influence tastes and the development of different food production systems. Examples are:
	- Desire for more organic food in the US has led to the growth of organic farming
	- In MEDCS, there ahs been a growing trend for concern about animal welfare which has affected the farming methods adopted by some farms. For example, free-range pigs and chickens
	- Environmental constraints, like rainfall, growing seasons, natural disasters, and soil fertility can influence choice of farming practices.
