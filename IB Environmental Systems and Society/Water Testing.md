# Why do we test for Nitrogen and Phosphorus?
- We are testing to see if there are high levels of Nitrogen and Phosphorus
- If there is, the source can be either fertilizers or fecal matter, which both contain nitrogen and phosphorus
- Rain washes nitrates and phosphates from cultivated land into surface waters, where they promote the rapid growth of plants and algae, in turn speeding up the rate of eutrophication and create dead zones
	- Nitrogen levels equal to 1 ppm or greater can accelerate natural eutrophication
	- Phosphorus levels of .1 ppm or greater can accelerate natural eutrophication in freshwater, where phosphorus is usually the limiting nutrient
# Why are we testing pH?
- Many freshwater organisms have adapted to a specific pH range
- A sudden or drastic change in pH will kill some of these organisms or make them unable to reproduce, disrupting the food chain and the aquatic community
- Pure water with a pH of 7 is neutral but rarely exists naturally
- Saltwater typically is slightly basic with a pH of 8 or higher
- Freshwater usually has a pH of 6.5, but this varies greatly between bodies of water
- Normal rain has a pH of 5.6 (due to dissolved carbon dioxide from the atmosphere forming carbonic acid)
# Why are we testing for Dissolved Oxygen?
- Dissolved oxygen (DO) refers to the volume of oxygen that is contained in water
- The amount of dissolved oxygen determines the number and types of organisms living in that body of water
- For example, fish like trout are sensitive to low DO levels (less than 8 parts per million)
- Decay of organic material in water can severely reduce dissolved oxygen concentration due to bacteria using oxygen to decompose organic matter
# Why are we testing for Temperature?
- Temperature of water sample is required for dissolved oxygen test.
- Temperature of water can provide information if thermal pollution is occurring
- Higher than normal water temperatures can lead to eutrophication
# Why are we testing for Turbidity?
- Test measures the clarity of water or suspended solids in the water.
- Fine particles, such as eroded soil, and microscopic organisms, such as plankton, contribute to water turbidity.
- Turbid waters clog the gills of fish, hinder disinfection processes, and carry entrapped pollutants downstream
- Turbid waters also block sunlight, preventing photosynthesis and increasing water temperature.
- Turbidity is measured in Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) or Jackson Turbidity Unit (JTU)
- Secchi discs are put on the bottom of white containers to measure turbidity
