# Aquatic Food Demand
- Demand for aquatic food resources continues to increase as human population grows and diet changes.
- As people become wealthier and more health conscious, their diets ill include more meat, fish, and dairy products.
- When looking at the increase in demand for food resources, consideration should be given to changes in attitude towards "health foods" and food fashions.
# Food Webs
- Photosynthesis by phytoplankton supports a highly diverse range of food webs.
- Phytoplankton, since they produce their own food, are considered primary producers. They are found in the photic zone (most sunlight)
- The highest rates of productivity are found near coastlines or in shallow seas, where upwellings and nutrient enrichment of surface waters occurs.
# What's Harvested by Humans
- Wild fisheries are also known as "capture fisheries"
- Aquatic (freshwater and marine) fish are harvested by humans
- Harvesting some species, such as seals and whales, can be controversial
- Ethical issues arise over bio rights, rights of indigenous cultures and international conservation legislation.
