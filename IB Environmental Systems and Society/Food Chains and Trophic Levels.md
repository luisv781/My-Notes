# Food Chains
**Food chains** are flows of energy from one organism to the nest organism.
- Organisms are grouped into trophic / feeding levels
**Trophic Levels** are the position that an organism occupies in a food chain

Producers
- Autotrophs
- Chemosynthetic organisms
Consumers
- Herbivores
- Carnivores
- Omnivores
Decomposers
Detritivores
# Producers
Plants, Algae and some bacteria are producers
**Autotrophs** / Photoautotrophs - Organisms that use sunlight energy to create their own food: all green plants
**Chemosynthetic** - Some bacteria create their own food without sunlight using simple compounds:
- Ammonia
- Hydrogen Sulfide
- Methane
# Consumers
**Consumers** (heterotrophs) are organisms that can't make their own food and eat other organisms to obtain energy and matter
Consumers pass energy and biomass from producers through to the top carnivores
# Herbivores
**Herbivores** feed on autotrophs / producers
These consumers keep each other in check through negative feedback
Examples - Rabbits, deer, butterflies, lotus
Also assist in seed disperse (Seed spreading)
# Carnivores
**Carnivores** feed on other heterotrophs / consumers
Examples - Lions, sharks, Venus fly traps
# Omnivores
Feed on *both* consumers and producers
Examples - Humans, bears, racoons
# Decomposers
Obtain their food and nutrients from the *breakdown of dead organic matter*.
Digest and decompose organic matter using enzymes that dissolve the material and absorb the nutrients.
Examples - Bacteria, fungi, some insects
# Detritivores
Derive their energy from detritus or *decomposing organic material* - dead organism or feces or parts of an organism
Eat dead plant and animal matter, breaking it down mechanically by chewing and grinding.
Examples - Worms, woodlice, millipedes, snails, slugs
