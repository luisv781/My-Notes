# What is a Projectile?
- An object launched such that the only force acting is gravity
- "free-fall"- gravity is the only force acting
- Gravity is assumed to be constant (near surface of planet)
	- $g=9.8\text{m/s}^{2}$
- Air resistance is negligible
## Trajectory
The shape of a simple projectile is a parabola
# A projectile is a combination of these motions
- Horizontal (x): no acceleration, constant velocity motion
- Vertical (y): constant acceleration of g down, uniformly accelerated motion

# Projectiles fired at angles
- Find the horizontal and vertical components of the initial velocity, then solve like normal
- Where is the vertical component of a projectile's motion zero?
	- At the top of the trajectory. Horizontal component is still nonzero

- The time to get back to the initial height is $2 * \text{time to the top of trajectory}$
- Then $v_{y}$ will be the same magnitude (but in the opposite direction) as the motion zero
