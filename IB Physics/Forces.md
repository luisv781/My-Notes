- Forces are pushes or pulls on objects (vectors) which cause accelerations
- If all forces cancel an object is in **translational equilibrium** and will move at a constant velocity
	- Equilibrium does not mean no forces. It means that all the forces are equal.
- Free-Body diagrams help us to identify all of the forces acting on a particular object or system
- **Friction** is a surface force that resists motion and is related to the normal force (R)
> There is no difference between standing still and moving in a constant velocity.
