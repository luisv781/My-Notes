### Kinematics
When motion begins. Mass does not matter for kinematics equations

**Fundamental Kinematics Equations**
$$
\text{1. } v = u + at
$$
$$
\text{2. } s = ut + \frac{1}{2} at^{2}
$$
$$
\text{3. } v^{2} = u^{2} + 2as
$$
$$
\text{4. } s = \frac{u+v}{2}t
$$

> These can only be used when a is constant. (Acceleration is *constant* and doesn't change)

V = Final Velocity
u = Initial Velocity (change in distance / change in time)
a = Acceleration (change in velocity / change in time)
s = Displacement/Distance
t = Time
### Dynamics
Deals with how the motion happens.
