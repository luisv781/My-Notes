# What are Systems?
Approach in a way of visualizing a complex set of interactions which may be ecological or societal.

Two types of systems...
## Reductionist
- Divides systems into parts, or components, and each part is studied separately.
## Holistic 
- A systems this studies as a whole that looks at patterns and processes which describe the whole system.
- The big picture

> Reductionist would be studying a small chunk of something (example- process of evaporation), while Holistic is like looking at the whole body. (example- the water cycle)

# Components of a System
A system is comprised of:
- Storages
- Flows
	- The flows provide inputs and outputs of energy and matter
	- The flows are processes that may be either
		- **Transfers** (a change in location)
		- **Transformations** (a change in the chemical nature, a change in state or a change in energy)

| All systems have:                                                              | Represented by:                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| STORAGES or stores of matter or energy                                         | a box                                      |
| FLOWS into, through and out of the system                                      | arrows                                     |
| INPUTS                                                                         | arrows in                                  |
| OUTPUTS                                                                        | arrows out                                 |
| PROCESSES which transfer or transform energy or matter from storage to storage | e.g. respiration, precipitation, diffusion |


- When contracting a system ... (didnt write down)

**Transfers**- When energy or matter flows and changes location. State stays the same.
**Transformations**- When energy or matter flows and changes its state. Change in chemical nature, state, or energy.

## Open System
An open system exchanges both energy and matter across its boundary
Ecosystems are open systems because matter and energy are exchanged with environment
- Reasons why ecosystems are open systems:
	- Nitrogen from air fixed by soil bacteria
	- Water lost through evaporation an transpiration from plants
	- Plants convert sunlight to energy by photosynthesis
## Closed System
A closed system exchanges *only energy* but no matter with its environment
Closed systems mostly exist artificially
- Bottle gardens
- Aquarium
> Sunlight (energy) can enter the bottle garden, but no matter can escape it because it is closed.
> [Example of closed system](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2267504/The-sealed-bottle-garden-thriving-40-years-fresh-air-water.html)- The 40 year old bottle garden
## Isolated System
An isolated system is a **hypothetical** concept in which *neither energy nor matter* is exchanged across the boundary.

> Transformations- Evaporation, sublimation, etc.
> Transfers- Advection, precipitation, etc.
