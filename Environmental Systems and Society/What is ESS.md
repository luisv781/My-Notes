### Environmental Movement
The worldwide campaign to raise awareness, and coordinate action to tackle te negative effects that humans are having on the planet.

### Significant Moments
- Environmental Disasters

#### Gaia - James Lovelock
The Earth functions as a single organism. The book explores a hypothesis, named after the ancient Greek goddess of Earth, that the Earth works as a single entity. The Earth's living matter influences air, ocean, and rock to form a self-regulating system that has the capacity to keep the Earth a fit place for life.

### Technological Innovation
- Green Revolution
	- Refers to the time between the 1940s to 1960s when development in scientific research and technology helped with productivity in agriculture
- Other Technological innovations have been created
	- Alternative to fossil fuels

### Three different viewpoints
#### Ecocentric View
- Integrates social, spiritual and environmental dimensions into a holistic ideal
- It puts ecology and nature as central to humanity and emphasizes a less materialistic approach to life with greater self-sufficiency of societies
- Prioritizes biorights, emphasizes the importance of education and encourages self-restraint in human behavior
#### Anthropocentric View (Environmental Manager)
- Argues that humans must sustainably manage the global system
- This might be by using taxes, environmental regulation and legislation
- Debate would be encouraged to reach a consensual, reasonable approach to solving environmental problems
#### Technocentric View (Cornucopian)
- Argues that technological developments can provide solutions to environmental problems
- This is a consequence of a largely optimistic view of the role humans can play in improving the lot of humanity
- Scientific research is encouraged in order to form policies and to understand how systems can be controlled, manipulated, or changed to solve resource depletion
- A pro-growth agenda is deemed necessary for society's improvement

### Intrinsic Value
Intrinsic Value means the measure of what an asset, in this case natural resources, is worth financially.
Giving natural resources intrinsic value becomes troublesome in protecting or restoring ecosystems because if financial institutions don't see them as a source of profit, there is little incentive to protect and restore
*Solution: Natural environment should be valued just because it exists.*
