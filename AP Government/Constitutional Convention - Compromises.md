>Size of the population of each state and whether they're free or slave states.
>*All states had slaves*, this only describes how much each state economically depended on them.

# The Great Compromise
The debate about representation in the *legislative* branch was considered the *most important*, and two competing plans emerged.

> There was a lot of going back and forth. Nothing was continuous, and topics would be dismissed for later (days, months, ...).

Madison and Hamilton came up with **The Virginia Plan** (Bicameral legislature)
- House #1 (Representation based on population)
	- Elected by the People
- House #2 (Also based on population)
	- Elected by the state legislatures
- Executive Branch elected by legislature
> This benefited larger states

**The New Jersey Plan** (Unicameral)
- House #1 (All states are equal)
	- Elected by the state legislatures
	- 2-7 members per state
	- All states get only one vote
- Executive Branch elected by legislature

> They were all afraid of giving the Executive Branch too much power. They needed it to owe their job to the Legislative.

*The debate threatened to end the entire Convention.* Roger Sherman of Connecticut proposed a *compromise*.

**The Connecticut Plan**
- House #1 (Representation based on population) (House of Representatives)
	- Elected by the people
- House #2 (All states are equal) (Senate)
	- Elected by the state legislatures
	- *Each state gets 2*, and they do not vote as a bloc.

Many of the large states objected to this because *they felt they would still bear too much of a tax burden.*

> Both sides don't love it, *but it was acceptable to them*. Big states feared taxes were going to be based on population size (They're going to have to pay more, just to get the same representation as others).

Benjamin Franklin proposed that all revenue bills originate in the lower house (House #1), to allow the large states to have more control.
## Slavery
**Slavery** was another major issue of debate, centering around outlawing it, regulating it and the counting of slaves.
When abolishing slavery was suggested, *GA, NC and SC stated they would not join a union without slavery*. (VA would probably have not joined either)
If abolishing was not going to happen, the Northern states wanted to *prohibit the country's involvement in the international slave trade*.
A compromise was worked out, that *Congress could not interfere with importation or exportation of slaves until 1808* (20 years), but could tax the trade.
> This was *a win for the southern states*, and a *huge* amount of slaves was brought in. The states *recognized that it might get outlawed in the future* and brought in as many as they could.
	
The question of *counting of slaves with regards to representation was the other major issue*. Do you count the slaves or not? The Native Indians weren't counted.
Southern states wanted slaves to be counted in the population for representation purposes, while Northern states wanted slaves to be counted as property for taxation purposes.
> Southern states wanted slaves to be counted to get more power. Northern states disagreed because they were being treated as property and they couldn't even vote.

The **Three-Fifths Compromise** was struck in which enslaved people would be counted as 3/5 of a person for representation and 3/5 of the value for taxes.
> Another *massive* win for the south. People in the north voted for themselves, while people in the south voted for themselves and a portion of the slaves. This also altered presidential elections

Southern states accepted this because *it gave them more voting power*, and taxation on property seemed improbable.

## Electoral College
*Selecting the Executive of the country* also was tied to the issue of slavery.
If the executive was directly selected by the people, then large Northern states would probably win most elections, so Southern states objected to this.
**The Electoral College** was a compromise for this. That the *people would elect electors chosen by the state legislatures*.
Each state would get the number of electors they had in Congress.
Senators (2) + Representatives = Number of electors
The electors would then select the President.
This gave the Southern states more power because of the 3/5 compromise and more say in selecting the President.
> With this, you are adding the slave population into the mix (Half the population, which doesn't get to vote).
