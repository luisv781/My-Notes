# Congress - House of Representatives
- 435 total members, elected every two years
- There are positions of power in the House. The **Speaker of the House** is *elected* by the members of the chamber.
- Then there is a *majority leader*, *minority leader*, *majority whip* and *minority whip*.
	- These are the leaders of the two political parties
- Whip - makes sure everyone stays in line and does what they're supposed to do. Step right before becoming the leader.
# Congress - Senate
- 100 total members, senators elected for 6 years. 1/3 of the senate is up for election every 2 years.
- The positions in the Senate are the majority and minority leaders as well as whips.
# How a Bill gets through Congress
- Any member of the Chamber can propose a bill
- Once introduced, the bill is referred to a committee for review, which includes hearings, amendments and markup.
- Once out of committee, the bill goes to the full chamber for debate.
- If it passes the chamber that proposed it, the process repeats in the other. The process is the same in both, but the debate might be different.
- If the bill passes both chambers with *identical* language it is sent to the President.
- If not, then a **conference committee** is established to work out the details. Then it goes back for debate and voting by both chambers.

- The Speaker determines when a bill will be debated and voted on.
- In the House, debate is very structured. The leadership of both parties are allocated a set amount of time by the Speaker.
- The leadership then gives time to members to voice their support of opposition to the bill.
- Once the time has expired the bill is voted upon.

- In the Senate, the majority leader *sets the calendar* and debate there is much less formal.
- Senators can speak for *as long as they want* and *does not have to stay on topic*.
- Other senators *cannot speak* unless the speaker gives them permission.
- This can lead to a **filibuster**, in which one person or a group *attempted to kill a bill by talking*.
- An attempt can be made to *end a filibuster* with a *closure vote* but requires 60 senators.
