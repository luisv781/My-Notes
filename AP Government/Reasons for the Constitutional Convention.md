## Problems with Governing
The state and national governments had *huge amounts of debt* from fighting the war, Congress *could not raise taxes*, because the Articles forbid it.
A 5% tax on all imported goods to raise money to pay the debt, was proposed, but the required amending the articles. It *failed* by one vote (Rhode Island).
States could raise taxes, but many farmers *did not have cash*, so they worked on a **barter system**.
If one could not pay their tax debt, their *land would be confiscated* and sold at an auction.

> A class conflict occurred because of this. If a farmer can't pay his taxes and loses his land, it would be sold and a richer person could buy the land.

A rebellion in W. Massachusetts broke out, led by **Daniel Shay**. They raided courthouses to stop the confiscations. The state could not stop it, neither could the national government, a privately funded army stopped Shay's Rebellion.
> This crisis caused people to notice that the Articles weren't working. If something like this could happen in Massachusetts, it could happen in another state too.

The rebellion frightened many Americans about the government's inability to deal with crisis.
**James Madison** and **Alexander Hamilton** called for a meeting to discuss altering the Articles of Confederation.
In May 1787, 55 delegates from 12 states(not Rhode Island) met to discuss amending the Articles. This meeting became the **Constitutional Convention**.

There were five major issues at the convention:
1. Representation
	- Big states wanted more representation. 
	- Every state got *only one vote*.
1. State vs Federal Power
2. Executive Power
	- No president. They needed someone that could be in charge.
3. Slavery
	- Should slaves be counted as people or property?
4. Commerce
	- Every state had their own currency.
	- Can a state have a trade deal with another country?
These conflicts required the art of *compromise*.
