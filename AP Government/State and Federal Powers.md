# States vs. Federal Power
- Federalism is *the sharing of power* between the states and Federal government.
- These powers are either exclusive (only one has it), or concurrent (meaning both have it)
- Powers that are exclusive are called *enumerated*. They are listed in the Constitution for the Federal government, but also *implied* because of the **Necessary and Proper Clause**.
- *Reserved* powers are those *not* enumerated to the Federal Government, and therefore are reserved to the states because of the **10th Amendment**.

> [!note] Enumerated vs. Implied
> Enumerated powers are powers that were written down explicitly in the Constitution. Implied powers are powers that aren't written in the Constitution but are still given.

## United States v. Lopez (1995)
- Alfonzo Lopez, 12th grader, brought a handgun to his high school in San Antonio
- He was charged with violating the Federal Law, Gun-Free School Zone Act, which prohibited guns in school zones passed in 1990.
