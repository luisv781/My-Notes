# Congressional Elections
- There is a limit of 435 seats in Congress, so every 10 years they are reapportioned. Some states gain seats while some lose seats.
- State legislatures draw the maps for the Congressional districts, with few restrictions.
	- **Baker v. Carr** - Supreme Court ruled that reapportionment can be heard in court.
	- **Reynolds v. Sims** - Ruled that each district should be about the same number of people. "One Person, One Vote."
	- Race cannot be a factor in drawing the district lines, but Political affiliation can.
- The political affiliation aspect has led to **Gerrymandering**. That is the drawing of district lines to maximize the electoral strength of one party.
	- Two methods of Gerrymandering:
		- **Cracking** - Breaking up the opposing party voters into numerous districts, but keeping it below 50%
		- **Packing** - Putting as many voters from the opposing party into a single district
