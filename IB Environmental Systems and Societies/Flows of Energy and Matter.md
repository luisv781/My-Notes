# Flow of Matter
Matter also flows through ecosystems linking them together . This flow of matter involves transfers and transformations.
The carbon and nitrogen cycles are used to illustrate this flow of matter using flow diagrams. These cycles contain storages (sometimes referred to as sinks) and flows, which move matter between storages.
# Nutrient Cycles
Matter cycles between the biotic and abiotic environment
Nutrient cycles can be shown in a diagram which shows *stores and transfers of nutrients*.
The factors that affect the store of nutrients and their transfer are those that affect:
- The amount and type of weathering
- Overland run-off and soil erosion
- Amount of rainfall
- Rates of decomposition
- Type of vegetation
- Age and health of plants, fires
*Nutrients are circulated and reused frequently*
Natural elements can be absorbed by plants, either as gases or as soluble salts.
- Only carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen are needed in large quantities. (AKA macronutrients)
- Rest are trace elements/micronutrients and are needed in small quantities (magnesium, sulfur, and phosphorus)
Nutrients are taken by plants and built into new organic matter. Animals take nutrients when they eat plants.
- Nutrients return to the soil when plants and animals die and are broken down by the decomposers, and when animals defecate and excrete.
All nutrient cycles involve interaction between soil and the atmosphere, and food chains.
Nutrient cycles can be sedimentary based, in which the source of the nutrient is from rocks (the phosphorus cycle), or atmospheric based (nitrogen cycle).
Matter flows through and between ecosystems, linking them together.
This flow of matter involves transfers and transformations.
# Transfers and Transformations
## Transfers
Energy / matter flows and *changes location*. State stays the same
- Carnivores eating other animals
- Water moving from a river to a sea
## Transformations
Energy / matter flows and *changes its state*. Change in chemical nature, state, or energy.
- Liquid to gas
- Burning fossil fuels
- Photosynthesis
# Carbon Cycle
Storages in the carbon cycle include organisms and forests (both organic), or the atmosphere, soil, fossil fuels and oceans (all inorganic).
Flows in the carbon cycle include consumption, death and decomposition, photosynthesis, respiration, dissolving and fossilization.
## Transfers
- Herbivores feeding on producers
- Decomposers feeding on dead organic matter
- Carbon dioxide from rainwater dissolving in oceans
## Transformations
- Photosynthesis transforms carbon dioxide and water into glucose using sunlight energy trapped by chlorophyll
- Respiration transforms organic matter such as glucose into carbon dioxide and water
- Combustion transforms biomass into carbon dioxide and water
- Fossilization transforms organic matter in dead organisms into fossil fuels through incomplete decay and pressure
# Nitrogen Cycle
Storages in the nitrogen cycle:
- Living organisms
- Soil, fossil fuels, atmosphere, and water bodies (all inorganic)
Flows
- Nitrogen fixation by bacteria and lightning
- Absorption, assimilation
- Consumption, excretion
- Death and decomposition, and denitrification by bacteria in water-logged soils
Nitrogen is an essential building block of amino acids (which link together to make proteins) and DNA. It is a *vital* element for all organisms.
## Transfers
- Carnivores feeding on herbivores
- Plants absorbing nitrates through their roots
- Removal of metabolic waste products from an organism (excretion)
## Transformations
- Lightning transforms nitrogen in the atmosphere into NO3. This is called nitrogen fixation.
- Nitrogen-fixing bacteria transform nitrogen gas in the atmosphere into ammonium ions.
- Nitrifying bacteria transform ammonium ions into nitrite and then nitrate
- Denitrifying bacteria transform nitrates into nitrogen
- Decomposers break down organic nitrogen (protein) into ammonia. (Deamination)
- Nitrogen from nitrates is used by plants to make amino acids and protein (assimilation).
# Pollution
Human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, urbanization and agriculture impact energy flows as well as the carbon and nitrogen cycles.
