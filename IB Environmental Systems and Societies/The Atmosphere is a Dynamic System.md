# Our Atmosphere is a Dynamic System
- The atmosphere is a dynamic system (with inputs, outputs, flows and storages) which has undergone changes throughout geological time
- Earth's atmosphere can be seen as an almost closed system
	- Input from solar radiation
	- Output is heat energy
	- Matter is recycled in system
	- Meteors and spacecraft make it "almost" because they pass atmosphere
- The atmospheric system is an interactive system consisting of five major components:
	- The atmosphere
	- The hydrosphere (oceans, lakes and rivers)
	- The cryosphere (ice sheets, glaciers and snow)
	- The land surface
	- The biosphere (plants and animals)
- The atmospheric system is driven by external forces, notably the Sun
- However, other forces are important too, such as
	- Sunspot activity
	- Volcanic activity
	- Continental drift
	- Larger-scale changes in the Earth's axial tilt
	- Its orbital path around the Sun
# Changes Over Geological Time
- Levels of CO2 and temperature have changed throughout the history of the Earth
- Today, levels are increasing due to human activity
- Ocean phytoplankton supply 70% of the world's oxygen and help maintain the protective ozone layer in the stratosphere.
- The Earth's atmosphere today contains about 400 parts per million (ppm) carbon dioxide (CO2) - this is 0.4% of the atmosphere
- Humans have added up to 2.7 gigatons (Gt) of carbon to the atmosphere every year, increasing carbon dioxide levels from 280 ppm in preindustrial times to 379 ppm today.
- Climate Change or global warming is happening due to:
	- Global industrialization and the subsequent production of pollution
	- Fossil fuel emissions
	- Deforestation, particularly of rainforest
	- Minor reasons like volcanic activity and sunspot activity
# Atmospheric Gases
- The atmosphere contains a mix of gases, liquids and solids
- The atmosphere is a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen, with smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, water vapor and other trace gases
- Examples of solids such as dust, ash, soot and salt
- Other important gases like helium, ozone, hydrogen, and methane.
- Without ozone in the stratosphere layer, most living things would die from UV-C
# Earth's Energy Budget
- Greenhouse gases, such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane, are gases that absorb infrared (long-wave) radiation that can lead to global warming.
- Earth's energy is mostly derived from the Sun. Insolation refers to incoming solar radiation
- Of the solar energy that travels to Earth,
	- 46% is absorbed by the Earth
	- 22% drives the hydrological cycle
	- 1% powers the winds and ocean currents
	- 31% is reflected to space
# Human Activities and Atmospheric Composition
- Human activities impact the atmospheric composition through altering inputs and outputs of the system.
- Changes in the concentrations of atmospheric gases (ozone, carbon dioxide, and water vapor) have significant effects on ecosystems
- Increases in levels of other gases (ex: methane and nitrous oxide) are also linked to human activity
- Global warming is an increase in the average temperature of the Earth's atmosphere.
- The main human activities releasing greenhouse gases are:
	- Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas)
	- Deforestation affects carbon dioxide levels by: Less trees, less CO2 is removed by photosynthesis
	- Intensive cattle farming has led to increased methane levels from cattle poop
	- Rice farming in paddy fields causes anaerobic bacteria to thrive and increases methane
	- Using fertilizers in farms has led higher nitrous oxide in air
- Most reactions connected to living systems occur in the inner layers of the atmosphere which are
	- Troposphere (0-10 km above sea level) (0-6 miles)
	- Stratosphere (10-50km above sea level) (6-31 miles)
- Pollutants that are released into the air would mainly affect those two lower layers of the atmosphere
- For example, the Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that were previously used in refrigerants, damaged the ozone layer in the stratosphere.
# Clouds
- Clouds are made of water
- They can be classified by form/shape and height
- Most clouds form in the troposphere and play an important role in the albedo effect for the planet.
- *The albedo effect* refers to an object's ability to reflect things
	- If the object receives a score of "1", then it is *very reflective*
	- If it gets a "0", it has *no reflection* abilities
	- The range is from 0 to 1 with decimal values in between
- Certain types of clouds have a high albedo, therefore they reflect most of the sun's radiation. The clouds that have a lower albedo will reflect less solar radiation.
- High Clouds: made of Ice Crystals
- Medium Clouds: made of Water Droplets
- Low Clouds: Indicate wet weather
- Nimbostratus clouds produce rain
# Green House Effect
- IR stands for Infrared radiation, which are the longer waves of solar radiation that are "trapped" by greenhouse gases
## The "Enhanced" Greenhouse Effect
- The *enhanced* greenhouse effect - or accelerated greenhouse effect - refers to the anthropogenic (human induced) global warming as a result of increased use of greenhouse gases.
- Due to emissions that come from fossil fuels, this causes more heat to be trapped within the atmosphere.
- The greenhouse gases from the natural effect come from the Carbon Cycle, Water Cycle, and Nitrogen Cycle (Nitrous Oxide)
