# Solar Radiation
As solar radiation (insolation) enters the Earth's atmosphere, some energy becomes unavailable for ecosystems as this energy is absorbed by inorganic matter or reflected back into the atmosphere.
Overall, only around 0.06% of all the solar radiation falling on the Earth is captured by plants.
# Energy Pathways
Pathways of energy though an ecosystem include
- Conversion of light to chemical energy
- Transfer of chemical energy from one trophic level to another with varying efficiencies
- Overall conversion of ultraviolet and visible light to heat energy by an ecosystem
- Re-radiation of heat energy to the atmosphere
# Energy Transfer in Food Chains
On average, *one tenth* of the energy available to one trophic level becomes available to the next.
Ultimately all energy lost from ecosystem is in the form of heat.
Heat energy is re-radiated into the atmosphere.
# Ecological Efficiency
Food chains have a loss of chemical energy from one trophic level to the next.
Ecological Efficiency - The percentage of energy transferred from 1 trophic level to the next.
$$
\text{Ecological Efficiency}=\left( \frac{\text{energy used for growth}}{\text{energy supplied}} \right)*100
$$
Example:
If energy used for new growth (0.1 J converted to new biomass in the blackbird) and 1 J of energy is available (the amount of energy consumed by the blackbird), then the ecological efficiency is (0.1 J / 1 J energy) x 100 = 10%

# Productivity
Production of biomass per unit area per unit time
Productivity occurs at each level of a food chain, and depending on where productivity occurs, it is referred to *primary* or *secondary* productivity.
## Primary Productivity
The gain by producers (autotrophs) in energy or biomass per unit area per unit time.
Primary production is highest where conditions for growth are optimal.
- High levels of insolation
- A good supply of water
- Warm temperatures
- High nutrient level
## Gross and Net Productivity
### Gross productivity
The *total gain in energy or biomass* per unit area per unit time.
### Net productivity
The gain in energy or biomass per unit area per unit time *remaining* after allowing for *respiratory losses*.
### Gross Primary Productivity (GPP)
The equivalent to the *mass of glucose created by photosynthesis* per unit are per unit time in primary producers.
### Net Primary Productivity (NPP)
Calculated by subtracting respiratory losses (R) from gross primary productivity (GPP).
NPP = GPP - R
## Secondary Productivity
The *biomass gained by heterotrophic organisms*, through feeding and absorption, measured in units of mass or energy per unit area per unit time
Secondary productivity depends on the amount of food present and the efficiency of consumers turning this into new biomass.
### Gross Secondary Productivity (GSP)
The *total energy or biomass assimilated by consumers* and is calculated by subtracting the mass of fecal loss from the mass of food consumed.
GSP = food eaten - fecal loss
GSP is the total energy gained through absorption and consumption in consumers.
### Net Secondary Productivity (NSP)
The gain by consumers in energy or biomass per unit area per unit time remaining after allowing for respiratory losses (R).
NSP is calculated by subtracting respiratory losses (R) from GSP.
NSP = GSP - R
# Maximum Sustainable Yield
The maximum flow of a given resource such that the stock does not decline over time
In other words, highest rate of harvesting that doesn't lead to a reduction in the original natural capital
They are equivalent to the net primary of a system
Also, they are *equivalent to the net secondary productivity* of a system
