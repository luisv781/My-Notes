# Succession
**Succession** is the process of *change over time in an ecosystem* involving pioneer, intermediate and climax communities.
Succession is a temporal phenomenon.
During succession, the patterns of energy flow, gross and net productivity, diversity, and mineral cycling change over time.
Greater habitat diversity leads to greater species and genetic diversity.
The change in communities from the earliest community to the final community is called a **sere**.
Succession on bare rock called **lithosere**, on freshwater habitat called **hydrosere**.
## Succession Stages
Successions can be divided into a series of stages, with each distinct community in the succession called a **seral stage**.
The first seral stage of a succession is called the **pioneer community**.
- The first stage of ecological succession that contains hardy species able to withstand difficult conditions
- Later communities in a sere are more complex than those that appear earlier
The final seral stage of a succession is called the **climax community**.
- Defined as the final stage of a succession
- More stable than earlier seral stages and is in equilibrium
## Primary vs Secondary Succession
### Primary Succession
- Succession is occurring on a *previously uncolonized substrate*
- Ex: Rock surfaces, new islands from volcanic eruptions
- Involved pioneer species like lichens and mosses
- Lichens and moss can photosynthesize and are effective at absorbing water, so they need no soil to survive (grow on rock)
- Trap particles and after dying, decompose they form a simple soil in which grasses can germinate, then shrubs and trees.
- Pioneers weather rocks, adding more soil
### Secondary Succession
- Occurs in places where a *previous community has been destroyed* (e.g. after forest fires, natural disasters)
- Secondary succession is *faster* than primary succession because of the *presence of soil and a seed bank*.
## Early Succession
- In early stages of succession, gross productivity is low due to the *unfavorable initial conditions* and *low density of producers*.
- The density of producers in the early stages of succession is low because of the *lack of soil, water, and nutrients*.
- The proportion of energy lost through community respiration is relatively low too, so net productivity is high- that is, the *system is growing and biomass is accumulating*.
- Early in the succession, there is *low biomes and few niches*.
- Mineral cycling forms an open system at early stages of succession (carbon and nitrogen).
## Late Succession
- In later stages of succession, with an increased consumer community, gross productivity may be high in a climax community
- In a complex ecosystem, the variety of nutrient and energy pathways contributes to its stability
- As the plant community grows, the number of niches increases. As the number of niches increases, the food webs become more complex and both habitat diversity and species diversity increase.
- Later in the succession, mineral cycling forms a more closed system. Elements such as carbon and nitrogen can remain and cycle within the system.
## Climax Community
- The *final stage of a succession* is the **climax community**
- A climax community is a community of organisms that is stable (in ready-state equilibrium), and is also in equilibrium with natural environmental conditions such as climate. It is the endpoint of ecological succession
- Organic matter increases as succession progresses because as pioneer and subsequent species die out, their remains contribute to a build-up of litter from their biomass
- There isn't just one climax community, but rather a set of alternative stable states for a given ecosystem. These depend on the climatic factors, the properties of the local soil and a range of random events that can occur over time.
### Major Features of a Climax Community
- Greater biomass
- Higher levels of species diversity
- More favorable soil conditions (e.g. greater organic content and deeper soil)
- Better soil structure (therefore greater water retention and aeration)
- Taller and longer-living plant species
- Greater community complexity and stability
- Greater habitat diversity
- Steady-state equilibrium
