# What is Biodiversity
- Biodiversity is a broad concept encompassing the total diversity of living systems, which includes the diversity of species, habitat diversity and genetic diversity
- Interpreting diversity is complex; low diversity can be present in natural, ancient and unpolluted sites (for example, in Arctic ecosystems)
# Species Diversity
- **Species diversity** in communities is a product of two variables: the number of species (richness) and their relative proportions (evenness). 
- Species diversity within a community is a component of the broader description of the biodiversity of an entire ecosystem.
- The higher the species diversity of a community or ecosystem, the greater the complexity.
- Areas of high species diversity are also more likely to be undisturbed (ex: rainforest).
# Richness and Evenness
- Both terms are components of biodiversity
- Richness is a term that refers to the number of a species in an area
- Evenness refers to the relative abundance of each species
- A community with high evenness is has a similar abundance of ll species - this implies a complex ecosystem where there are lots of different niches that support a wide range of different species.
- Low evenness refers to a community where one or a few species dominate - lower complexity and a smaller number of potential niches
- For richness accurate measures are required, accurate calculation of diversity indices, appropriate sample sizes are required.
# Communities
- Communities can be described and compared using diversity indices (formula for indices/index)
- When comparing communities that are similar, low diversity could be indicative of pollution, eutrophication or recent colonization of a site.
- The number of species present n an area is often indicative of general patterns of biodiversity.
- Diversity index can be determined with Simpson Diversity Index
- The higher result (D), the greater the species diversity. This indication of diversity is only useful when comparing two similar habitats, or the same habitat over time
# Habitat and Genetic Diversity
- Habitat diversity refers to the range of different habitats in an ecosystem or biome.
- For example, a woodland may contain many different habitats (river, soil, trees) and so have a high habitat diversity, whereas a desert has few (sand, occasional vegetation) and so has a low habitat diversity
- Genetic diversity refers to the range of genetic material present in a population of a species
- Genetic refers to genes, which are sections of DNA found in the nucleus of all cells. The instructions from which a species is produced.
- Gene pool refers to all the different types of gene found within every individual of a species.
- Large gene pool leads to high genetic diversity and a small gene pool to low genetic diversity
# Quantification of Biodiversity
- Quantification of biodiversity is important to conservation efforts so that areas of high biodiversity may be identified, explored, and appropriate conservation put in place where possible.
- The ability to assess changes to biodiversity in a given community over time is important in assessing the impact of human activity in the community.
