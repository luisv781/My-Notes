## Organization of Life
Organism -> Population -> Community -> Ecosystem -> Biosphere
# Communities
A **community** is a group of populations living and interacting with each other in a common habitat.
Communities include *all* biotic parts of the ecosystem, both plants and animals.
# Ecosystems
An **ecosystem** is a community and the physical environment with which it interacts.
An ecosystem includes *biotic and abiotic* stuff.
Ecosystems can be divided into three types:
- Terrestrial
- Marine
- Freshwater
## Terrestrial
**Terrestrial** ecosystems include all *land-based* ecosystems.
## Marine
**Marine** ecosystems include the ocean, estuaries, salt marshes, and mangroves.
Marine ecosystems all have a *high concentration of salt* in the water.
## Freshwater
Freshwater ecosystems are bodies of water with *little to no concentration of salt* in the water.
Include rivers, lakes and wetlands.
# Respiration and Photosynthesis
## Respiration
**Respiration** can be described as processes with inputs, outputs, and transformations of energy and matter. Controls the flow of energy through ecosystems.
Respiration is the *conversion of organic matter into carbon dioxide and water* in all living organisms, releasing energy.
**Aerobic respiration** can be represented by the following equation:
$$
\text{Glucose}+\text{Oxygen}\to \text{Carbon Dioxide}+\text{Water}
$$
During respiration, large amounts of energy are dissipated as heat, increasing the entropy in the ecosystem while enabling organisms to maintain relatively low entropy and high organization.
## Photosynthesis
**Photosynthesis** is also like respiration.
Photosynthesis converts light and chemical energy, which is stored in biomass.
Primary producers in most ecosystems convert light energy into chemical energy in the process of photosynthesis.
$$
\text{Carbon Dioxide}+\text{Water}\to \text{Glucose}+\text{Oxygen}
$$
Inputs
- Sunlight as energy source
- Carbon Dioxide
- Water
Outputs
- Glucose, used as an energy source for the plant and as the basic starting material for other organic molecules
- Cellulose and starch
- Oxygen, released to the atmosphere through stomata
Transformations
- The energy change is from light energy to stored chemical energy, and thus the chemical energy is stored in organic matter (carbohydrates, fats, and lipids/proteins)
- Chlorophyll is needed to capture certain visible wavelengths of sunlight energy and allow this energy to be transformed into chemical energy.
