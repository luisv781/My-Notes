## Vocabulary
- **Equilibrium** - A state in which opposing forces are balanced
- **Stability** - Being stable
- **Destabilizing** - Upsetting the stability of a system
- **Homeostasis** - The tendency toward a relatively stable equilibrium
- **Complexity** - The state of being complicated

# What is Equilibrium?
Equilibrium is the tendency of the system to return to an original state following disturbance.
- At equilibrium, a state of balance exists among the components of the system.
## Types of Equilibrium
- Steady-State Equilibrium
- Static Equilibrium
- Stable Equilibrium
- Unstable Equilibrium
## Steady-State Equilibrium
A steady-state equilibrium is the condition of an open system in which there are no changes over the longer term, but there may be small fluctuations in the very short term.
Example - weather can cause short-term disturbance.
## Static Equilibrium
- There isn't a change over time
- If it's disturbed, it will adopt a new equilibrium
- Static equilibrium can't happen in living systems due to life involving exchange of energy and matter with environment
## Stable Equilibrium
A stable equilibrium is the condition of a system in which there is a tendency for it to return to the previous equilibrium following a disturbance.
Equilibrium avoids sudden changes in a system, doesn't mean systems are non-changing.
## Unstable Equilibrium
During unstable equilibrium, system returns to a new equilibrium after the disturbance. (A new normalcy)
