# Measuring Change Along an Environmental Gradient
- Environmental gradients are changes in environmental factors through space or where an ecosystem suddenly ends
	- Examples: decreasing temperature with increasing altitude up a mountain
	- Forest edges (end of ecosystem)
- In these situations, both biotic and abiotic factors vary with distance and form gradients in which trends can be recorded.
- The techniques used in sampling such gradients are based on the quadrat method and are more easily done on vegetation and non-motile animals.
# Types of Quadrats that can be used
- Frame quadrats are empty frames of known area, such as 1-2m
- Grid quadrats are frames divided into 19=00 small squares with each square representing one percent. This helps in calculating percentage cover.
- Point quadrats are made from a frame with 10 holes, which is placed into the ground by a leg. A pin is dropped through each hole in turn and the species touched are recorded. The total number of pins touching each species is converted to percentage frequency data; for example, if a species touched 6 out of the 10 pins, it has 60 percent frequency
# Transects
- Since environmental variables change along a gradient, random quadrat sampling is not appropriate.
- All parts of the gradient need to be sampled, so a transect is used
- The simplest transect is a line transect - a tape measure laid out in the direction of the gradient
	- All organisms touching the tape are recorded
	- Many line transects need to be taken to obtain valid quantitative data.
## Belt Transect
- Larger samples can be taken with this type of transect
- This is a band of chosen width (usually between 0.5 and 1 m) laid along the gradient
- Belt transects sample a strip through the sample area
- Repetition is needed for a valid quantitative data
# Measuring Change Along an Environmental Gradient
- In both line and belt transects:
	- The whole transect can be sampled (a continuous transect)
	- Samples are taken at points of equal distance along the gradient (an interrupted transect)
- So that data are reliable and quantitatively valid, transects should be repeated - at least three times is recommended
- All transects can be located randomly or they can be systematically located following the random location of the first
- For example, subsequent transects might be located every 10m along a line perpendicular to the ecological gradient.
# Measuring Changes in an Ecosystem due to Human Activity
- Human impacts include
	- Toxins from mining activity
	- Landfills
	- Eutrophication
	- Sewage
	- Oil spills
	- Overexploitation
	- Change of land use (deforestation, development, or use for tourism activities)
	- Air pollution
- Methods you can use to study the effect of human activities:
	- Carry out capture-mark-release-recapture methods on invertebrate species in disturbed and undisturbed sites
	- Measure species diversity using the Simpson's index
	- Use indicator species
	- Measure variables such as light levels, temperature and wind speed
	- Measure soil erosion
	- Measure soil variables such as soil structure, nutrient content, pH, compaction levels, and soil moisture
- Lastly, you compare measurements taken from the disturbed area with those from undisturbed areas, so that you can work out the magnitude and effect of the disturbance.
## GIS
- GIS (Geographic Information System) data can be used to track changes in ecosystems over time
- An advantage of satellite images is visible nature of the photos is useful for motivating public opinion and action.
- A disadvantage is that they can be expensive to obtain and may not be available for the area being studied
- Another disadvantage is that although some biotic measurements can be taken, such as plant productivity, other biotic and abiotic components cannot be measured such as species diversity and relative humidity
- Best used in conjunction with ground studies so that the images can be matched with abiotic and biotic data from the ground
