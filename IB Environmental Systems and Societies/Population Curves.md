- S and J population curves
- Describe a *generalized response of populations to a particular set of conditions* (abiotic and biotic factors).
# S Population Curve
- An S-shaped population curve shows an *initial rapid growth* (exponential growth) and then *slows down as the carrying capacity is reached*
- There are 4 stages of S population curve
	- Lag Phase
	- Exponential Growth Phase
	- Transitional Phase
	- Stationary Phase
## Lag Phase
*Population numbers are low* leading to low birth rate
Explanation
- Few individuals colonize a new area
- because numbers of individuals are low, birth rates are also low
## Exponential Growth Phase
Population *grows at an increasingly rapid rate*
Explanation
- Limiting factors are not restricting the growth of the population
- There are favorable abiotic components such as temperature and rainfall, and a lack of predators or disease
- The number of individuals rapidly increases as does the rate of growth
## Transitional Phase
Population growth *slows down considerably* although continuing to grow
Explanation
- Limiting factors begin to affect the population and restrict its growth
- There is increased competition for resources
- An increase in predators and an increase in disease and mortality due to increases in the number of individuals living in a small area also cause a slow down in growth rate
## Stationary Phase
Population growth *stabilizes* (graph "flattens") and then *population fluctuates* around a level that represents the carry capacity
Explanation
- Limiting factors restrict the population to its carrying capacity (K)
- Changes in limiting factors, predations, disease, and abiotic factors cause population to increase and decrease around the carrying capacity
## Density-Dependent Factors
- **Density dependent factors** are usually biotic factors that *affect birth rate* and *increase death rate* of a population *as it approaches its carrying capacity*
- Disease, competition for limiting resources, parasitism, etc. Their effect increases with the growing density of a population.
# J Population Curve
- It's a population growth curve which shows *only* exponential growth
- Growth is *initially slow but becomes increasingly rapid* and *does not slow down* as population increases
- Organisms showing J-shaped curves tend to *produce many offspring rapidly* and have little parental care (insects such as locusts)
## J Population Factors
Exponential growth occurs when
- Limiting factors are not restricting the growth of the population
- There are plentiful resources such as light, space, and food
- There are favorable abiotic components, such as temperature and rainfall
Abiotic components can affect population growth
## Population Crash
The *sudden decrease in the population* is called a population crash
Populations showing J shaped curves are *generally controlled by abiotic* but not biotic components, although the lack of food can also cause populations to crash.
