Ecological pyramids are quantitative models that are usually measured for a given area and time.
Include pyramids of *numbers*, *biomass*, and *productivity*
The 2nd law of thermodynamics causes a tendency for numbers and quantities of biomass and energy to decrease along food chains. The pyramids become narrower towards the apex (top).
# Pyramid of Numbers
Pyramids of numbers record the *number of individuals* at each trophic level coexisting in an ecosystem.
Pyramids of numbers can sometimes display different patterns; for example, when individuals at lower trophic levels are relatively large (inverted pyramids)
Due to the 2nd law of thermodynamics (entropy) tendency for numbers to decrease along food chains, and so graphical models tend to be pyramids.
# Pyramid of Biomass
A pyramid of biomass quantifies the amount of biomass present at each trophic level at a certain point in time, and represents the *standing stock* of each trophic level.
Measured in units such as grams of biomass per square meter or Joules per square meter.
These pyramids also usually become narrower towards the top.
## Inverted Biomass Pyramids
Sometimes pyramids are inverted and show greater quantities at higher trophic levels. This is because they represent the biomass present at a given time. For example, a fertile, intensively grazed pasture may have a lower standing crop biomass of grass. The fertile pasture has biomass constantly removed by herbivores.
# Pyramid of Productivity (Energy Flow)
Pyramids of productivity show the flow of energy (rate at which stock is generated) through each trophic level of a food chain over a period of time. They show the flow of energy through an entire ecosystem over a year. This means they invariably show a decrease along the food chain.
Refer to the rate of flow of biomass or energy.
Measured in units of flow.
There are *no* inverted pyramids of productivity.
# Bioaccumulation and Biomagnification
**Bioaccumulation** is the *build-up* of persistent or non-biodegradable pollutants *within an organism* or trophic level because they cannot be broken down.
> As an organism eats pollutants, the pollutants will accumulate and won't leave.

**Biomagnification** is the *increase in concentration* of persistent or nonbiodegradable pollutants *along a food chain*.
Toxins such as DDT and mercury accumulate...
> There can be a little pollutant at the bottom, but as it goes up the trophic levels, it will accumulate into a lot.
