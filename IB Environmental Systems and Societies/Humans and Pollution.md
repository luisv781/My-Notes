# What is Pollution?
It's the *addition of a substance/agent* to an environment through human activity, at a rate greater than that at which it can be rendered harmless by the environment, and which has a *significant effect on the organisms* in the environment.
"Pollutant" and "Contaminant" are similar terms

Pollution *can be natural*, such as from volcanic eruptions, as well as human in origin.
It can be *deliberate or accidental*.
It includes the *release of substances which harm* the sustainable quality of air, water, and soil, and which reduces human quality of life.
# In what forms do pollutants exist?
- *Organic or Inorganic substances* (like pesticides and heavy metals)
- *Light, Sound or Thermal energy* (hot water being released to body of water)
- *Biological agents* or *Invasive species* (Pollen, cane toad in Australia, Asian Carp)
- Human activities including the *combustion of fossil fuels*
# Major Sources of Pollution
- Carbon dioxide
	- Greenhouse gases - climate change
- Sulphur dioxide
	- Acid deposition - tree and fish death
- Nitrogen oxides
	- Respiratory infections, eye irritation, smog
- Photochemical smog
	- Secondary pollutants - damage to plants, eye irritation
- Carbon monoxide
	- Binds with hemoglobin in red blood cells instead of oxygen - can lead to death by suffocation
## Agricultural Waste
- Nitrate
	- Eutrophication
- Organic waste
	- Eutrophication
- Pesticides
	- Accumulate up food chains
## Domestic Waste
- Organic waste (food and sewage)
	- Eutrophication, waterborne diseases
- Waste paper
	- Volume fills up landfill sites, forests cut to produce it
- Plastics - containers, packaging
	- Volume fills up landfill sites, derived from oil
- Glass
	- Energy required to manufacture it (as with all products), can be recycled but most goes into landfill sites
- Tins/cans
	- Can be recycled but also goes into landfill
## Industrial Waste
- Heavy metals
	- Poisoning, e.g. mercury, lead, cadmium
- Fluorides
	- Poisoning
- Heat
	- Reduces solubility of gases in water, so less oxygen so organisms may die
- Lead
	- Disabilities in children
- Acids
	- Corrosion
# Types of Pollutants
## Point and Non-Point Source Pollutants
- **Point Source Pollution** arises from a *single clearly identifiable* site
	- Sources of pollutants can be tracked cone from a single point
	- Ex: Nuclear explosions from Chernobyl, Ukraine and Fukushima, Japan
	- Point-source pollution can be *easily managed* because you can pinpoint location of pollutants
- **Non-Point Source Pollution** arises from *numerous widely dispersed* origins
	- Ex: Release of air pollutants from numerous, widely dispersed origins (vehicles that use fossil fuels)
	- Virtually *impossible to detect* where it's coming from
## Biodegradable and Persistent Pollutants
- "**Biodegradable**" means *capable of being broken down by natural biological processes*, light or heat
	- Are not stored in biological matter or passed along food chains
	- Ex: Most modern pesticides, used to treat crops are biodegradable
	- Soaps, domestic sewage, glyphosate (herbicide)
	- Paper and wood
- **Persistent organic pollutants (POPs)**, aka "forever chemicals", are *organic compounds* that are *resistant to environmental degradation* through chemical, biological, and photolytic processes
	- *Can't be broken down* by living organisms and are *passed along food chains*. It can remain in human and animal tissue
	- Ex: DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), PVC (polyvinyl chloride), PCB (polychlorinated biphenyls)
	- They *can pass through cell membranes*
### DDT: Persistent Organic Pollutant
- DDT was used in WW2 to control lice and mosquitoes. After war, it was used as an insecticide for farming.
- 1955 the World Health Organization was trying to eradicate malaria with DDT but most mosquitoes became resistant
- 1950-1980 DDT was used as insecticide in farming
- DDT was *banned by most countries* in the 70's and 80's, DDT can only be used for disease control. India and N. Korea use it for agriculture
- DDT is *harmful* because it *can be absorbed* and *build up in soils and fatty tissue*. Caused Cancer, Diabetes, Asthma, Pregnancy loss, Premature birth
	- DDT exemplifies a conflict between the utility of a "pollutant" and its effect on the environment
### Bioaccumulation and Biomagnification of DDT
- **Bioaccumulation** is the *retention or build-up of non-biodegradable* or slowly biodegradable chemicals in the body.
- **Biomagnification** or biological amplification is the process whereby the *concentration of a chemical increases at each trophic level*.
- The result is top predators may have in their bodies concentrations of a chemical *several million times higher* than the same chemical's concentration in water and primary producers
- DDT is believed to be a major reason for the decline of the bald eagles in North America in the 1950s and 1960s
## Primary vs. Secondary Pollutants
- **Primary Pollutants**: *active on emission*. A pollutant that is *put directly into the atmosphere* by human or natural activity.
	- Ex: gas released from burning coal and other fossil fuels
- **Secondary Pollutants**: *Arising from primary pollutants* undergoing physical or chemical change when they *react with other primary air pollutants*, natural components in the air, or both
	- Ex: ground level ozone, where the Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) from car exhausts reacts with sunlight to form tropospheric (ground level) ozone
## Acute vs. Chronic Pollution
- **Acute Pollution** is when *large amounts of a pollutant are released all at once*
	- Ex: In 1988, aluminum sulphate was accidently added to water treatment of Cornwall in UK. This resulted in many people being poisoned.
	- *Symptoms* from acute pollution exposure *happen after short exposure* and within hours, such as Asthma attacks
- **Chronic Pollution** results from *long-term release* of a pollutant
	- This form is *more serious* because *it can go undetected*, *spreads widely*, and *more difficult to clean*
	- Chronic health effects include lung cancer, heart disease, bronchitis.
## Model of Pollution Management
Becomes increasingly more expensive and difficult to do  ==>

| Educate                                            | Legislate                                                | Remediate                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Alter the activity that is producing the pollutant | Control the release of the pollutant through legislation | Clean up the pollutant and restore the ecosystem |
