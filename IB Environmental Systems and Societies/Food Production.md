# Sustainability of Terrestrial Food Production Systems
- The sustainability of terrestrial food production systems is influenced by factors such as: scale, industrialization, seed/crop/livestock choices, water use, pest control, pollinators, or legislation
- With increased standards of living around the world, diets have changed from mainly plant-based to more consumption of meat & dairy products
- Animal products require more resources to produce because only 10% of energy is passed on at each trophic level since they are in a higher trophic level.
- In the past 5 decades crop yields have increased due to technology. New farmland may have come from marginal land (land that doesn't have great potential for farming) or from natural ecosystems
- In the 1950s, there was a shift from producing food for people's needs (**subsistence farming**) to producing food for commercial profit
- **Agribusiness** (agri-industrialization) is food production that the goal is to maximize productivity and have a profitable return for capital investment
- The main characteristics of agribusiness are:
	- Large-scale monoculture (single-crop cultivation)
	- Intensive use of fertilizers and pesticides (loss of biodiversity/pollution/eutrophication)
	- Mechanized ploughing and harvesting
	- Food production geared to mass markets including export
- Freshwater use in the agribusiness industry is excessive
- 70% of the freshwater on Earth is used in agriculture
- Food production and processing systems contribute to global warming from large amounts of electricity and/or fossil fuels used
- Agriculture currently consumes approximately 3.1% of total global energy; this is divided into 2.5% in MEDCs and 0.6% in LEDCs.
- Around 260,000 species of flowering plants depend on bees for pollination
- Without pollinators, crops that bear fruit/seeds won't produce them
- Intensive animal farming involves antibiotic use since animals are kept in tightly packed pens, disease can quickly spread
# Inequalities in the Food Supply
- Many people in LEDCs are suffering from undernourishment or malnutrition
- Undernourishment: food intake doesn't contain enough energy
- Malnutrition: food intake lacks essential nutrients such as protein and minerals
- About 690 million people globally are undernourished
- MEDCs have surplus of food, with markets producing too much food for the population to consume
