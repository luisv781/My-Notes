## Vocabulary
**Thermodynamics** - branch of physics that deals with heat, work, and temperature, and their relation to energy, entropy, and the physical properties of matter and radiation
**Energy Transfer** - the relocation of energy from one place to another, usually in a different form
**Work** - the energy transferred to or from an object via the application of force along a displacement
**Laws of Thermodynamics** - describe the relationship between heat, work, temperature, and energy

# What is Energy?
Energy is the ability to work.
**Energy is in a variety of forms:**
- Light
- Heat
	- Heat can change its form when there is a temperature change.
- Chemical
- Electrical
- Kinetic

## Energy's Behavior
**1st Law of Thermodynamics** - The principle of conservation of energy, which states that energy in an isolated system *can be transformed but not created nor destroyed*.
The total energy in any isolated system, such as the entire universe, is constant.
- Energy is *always constant* in any system
- Energy can change its form
Available energy is used for
- Growth
- Movement
- Assembly
A.K.A. : Law of Conservation
*The amount of energy doesn't change, the amount available does.*
- Reduced through inefficient energy conversions.

**2nd Law of Thermodynamics** - Energy is transformed through energy transfers. Energy goes from a *concentrated form* (e.g Sun) into a *dispersed form* (e.g heat).
The availability of energy to do work decreases, causing a system to have increasing disorder.
States that the entropy of an isolated system not in equilibrium will tend to increase over time.

**Entropy** - the measure of disorder of a system and refers to the spreading out of energy
>[!note] Example
>A clean room will have low entropy. Eventually the room is going to get messier. (pillows on the ground, etc.) If the room is not cleaned, it will get high entropy because of the disorder.

Energy = work + heat
Energy spreads out so that the useful energy consumed by one trophic level is less than the total energy at the level below. There will always be a reduction in the amount of energy passed on to the next trophic level.
