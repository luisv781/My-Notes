# What is the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA)?
- Created in 2001 by the UN
- It focuses on how ecosystems have changed over the last decades and predicts changes that will happen
- **The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment** (MA) gave a scientific appraisal of the condition and trends in the world's ecosystems and the services they provide using environmental indicators.
## 2005 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment - Report
- Report wasn't good
	- Natural resources like food, freshwater, fisheries, timber, air are being use in a *degradable* way.
- Main points from 2005 report:
	- 60% of ecosystems have been degraded
	- 25% of Earth's land surface cultivated (37% used for agriculture in 2017)
	- We use 40-50% of available surface freshwater
	- Over 25% of fish stock harvested
	- Since 1980, 35% of mangroves are destroyed
	- About 20% of corals have been lost, and 20% degraded (50% destroyed in 2020, 40% could be lost in next 30 years)
	- Nutrient pollution (mainly fertilizers) has led to eutrophication of waters and dead (low-oxygen) coastal zones
# What is an EIA?
- It's a *report* prepared before a development project to change the use of land. Pros and Cons of project viewed
	- Examples: Planting a forest or converting a field to a golf course
- They *assess* the environmental, social, and economic *impacts* of the project, predicting and evaluating possible impacts and suggesting mitigation strategies for the project.
## What is an EIA used for?
- Part of *planning process* for large projects that most governments require
- Examines environmental impacts of new developments
- Examples of when EIAs are used:
	- Construction of roads and highways
	- Airport development
	- Power Stations
	- Dams
	- Housing Projects
## How did the EIA start?
- In the US, the government passed the **National Environmental Policy Act** (NEPA) in 1969
- Allowed Federal Agencies to consider the environment in any land use planning, giving natural environment the same status as economic concerns
- Within 20 years of the passage of NEPA, other countries also included EIAs
## What is an EIA?
- They are usually followed by an audit and continued monitoring. Each country or region has *different guidance* on the use of EIAs
- EIAs provide decision-makers
- There *isn't* a requirement to implement a EIA's proposals, and many socio-economic factors may influence the decisions

# What is an Ecological Footprint (EF)?
It's a model used to *estimate the demands* that human populations place on the environment.
The *area of land and water required* to sustainably provide all resources at the rate at which they are being consumed by a given population.

If the EF is *greater than* the area available to the population, this is an indication of *unsustainability*.
EFs vary in each country and include lifestyle choices(EVS), productivity of food production systems, land use and industry.
