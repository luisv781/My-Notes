# Biomes 
Biomes are collections of ecosystems sharing similar climatic conditions that can be grouped into five major classes: aquatic, forest, grassland, desert and tundra.
Each of these classes has characteristic limiting factors, productivity and biodiversity .
Insolation, precipitation and temperature are the main factors governing the distribution of biomes. 
Latitude also affects the types of biomes. Equator to North or South Poles. 
Insolation, precipitation and temperature are the main factors governing the distribution of biomes. 
# Biome Shifts 
Distribution of biomes is controlled by a combination of temperature, insolation, and precipitation. 
Climate change is altering the distribution of biomes and causing biome shifts. 
Increases in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases lead to an increase in average global temperature, which affects rainfall patterns. 
These changes in climate affect the distribution of biomes. 
# Spatial and Temporal Phenomenon 
## Spatial Phenomenon 
Communities can change along environmental gradients because of changes in the following factors: 
- Altitude 
- Latitude 
- Distance from sea on rocky shore 
This is also known as **Zonation** 
## Temporal Phenomenon 
Communities can change through time 

Example: Ecosystem changes as it develops from early stages to later ones. This is called **succession**.
